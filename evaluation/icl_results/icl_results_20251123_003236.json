    "question": "how accurate is sad test done within 6 days after unprotected sex",
    "patient_description": "hello doctor I had an sad test done five or six days after unprotected sex with a new partner the tests came back negative but I have learned that you should wait for different windows of time before getting tested for certain studs this was about seven months ago today I went to my gynecologist to get tested again for chlamydia and gonorrhea to ease my mind she said that the original tests were likely accurate given that just barely enough time had passed to be tested but suggested to get another test for peace of mind I did not think until after my appointment to ask if the doxycycline I am currently taking for my acne 100 my twice daily would alter the results I am wondering if the results I get in a week time will be accurate and if you think the original test was likely accurate in the first place",
