Also, I keep seeing blood in my urine which makes me scared of being pregnant, can you help me? Answer: Sure! Based on your statement that you are \"feeling weak and exhaustive\" and have experienced bleeding from urination, it sounds like you might be struggling with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Polycystics sufferers experience irregular periods, excessively high levels of insulin (due to an underactive pancreas), low levels of follicle stimulating hormones (FSH) or elevated levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and fatigue due to poor insulinaemia control. This could mean you are ovulating but unable to get pregnancies because of an imbalanced FSH/LH ratio, causing a condition known as polycystasis. It could also mean you have gestational diabetes, where your body produces too many insulins leading to a higher glucose count than normal, potentially causing extreme hunger and fatigues. Regardless of the cause of your unexplained symptoms, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms and establish a plan tailored to your needs. If you suspect polycistic infertility, such as a positive pregnantly you should speak with your fertilization specialists, they will work with information aboutxicryptogenital problemsomext fertility, Understandable huh oral andrologic hanging factors,ensey Insulin andfat",

    "generated_answer": "Based on your input, here's an updated version that includes additional information regarding your physical condition:\n\nNumbness and tenderness in the lower extremities are common in people who suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those with stage III renal failure. This condition can lead to severe joint damage, resulting in difficulty walking and standing. In some cases, these symptoms can be treated with conservative measures such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS), physical therapy, and supportive care measures. However, for more advanced cases of CKD or when nonmedical options fail, surgery may be necessary. In this scenario, you will require a consultation with one of our experienced nephrologists to discuss your specific case and determine the best course of action. We recommend keeping a journal of your symptoms, including the frequency and severity of your discomfort. Additionally, we would like to know whether you are able to perform activities of daily living without being unable to move freely or walking comfortably, regardless of the number of steps per day.

    "generated_answer": "Based on your history and examination findings, you are likely suffering from Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by sudden onset of weakness, paresthesias, and autonomic dysfunction affecting both upper and lower extremities. The most common cause of GBS is viruses such as poliovirus or enterovirus. This condition usually occurs within one month after contracting an infectious agent that triggers an immune response against itself. However, cases can occur suddenly without clear exposures. If you develop symptoms consistent with GBS, contact your healthcare provider immediately for guidance regarding appropriate management options.",
