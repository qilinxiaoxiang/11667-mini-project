Also, I keep seeing blood in my urine which makes me scared of being pregnant, can you help me? Answer: Sure! Based on your statement that you are \"feeling weak and exhaustive\" and have experienced bleeding from urination, it sounds like you might be struggling with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Polycystics sufferers experience irregular periods, excessively high levels of insulin (due to an underactive pancreas), low levels of follicle stimulating hormones (FSH) or elevated levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and fatigue due to poor insulinaemia control. This could mean you are ovulating but unable to get pregnancies because of an imbalanced FSH/LH ratio, causing a condition known as polycystasis. It could also mean you have gestational diabetes, where your body produces too many insulins leading to a higher glucose count than normal, potentially causing extreme hunger and fatigues. Regardless of the cause of your unexplained symptoms, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms and establish a plan tailored to your needs. If you suspect polycistic infertility, such as a positive pregnantly you should speak with your fertilization specialists, they will work with information aboutxicryptogenital problemsomext fertility, Understandable huh oral andrologic hanging factors,ensey Insulin andfat",

    "generated_answer": "Based on your input, here's an updated version that includes additional information regarding your physical condition:\n\nNumbness and tenderness in the lower extremities are common in people who suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those with stage III renal failure. This condition can lead to severe joint damage, resulting in difficulty walking and standing. In some cases, these symptoms can be treated with conservative measures such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS), physical therapy, and supportive care measures. However, for more advanced cases of CKD or when nonmedical options fail, surgery may be necessary. In this scenario, you will require a consultation with one of our experienced nephrologists to discuss your specific case and determine the best course of action. We recommend keeping a journal of your symptoms, including the frequency and severity of your discomfort. Additionally, we would like to know whether you are able to perform activities of daily living without being unable to move freely or walking comfortably, regardless of the number of steps per day.

Your condition requires prompt attention because RA can cause severe joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. You should seek immediate medical help if your symptoms persist or get worse. The following are some common treatments for RA:\n\n1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These include ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac. NSAIDS can ease inflammation and improve joint mobility. Ask your healthcare provider how much of these drugs to start and how long to take them.\n   Advice for self care:\n   Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.

    "generated_answer": "The role of germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancers is well understood but the mechanisms underlying these differences between male and female germ cells remain poorly understood. While studies have demonstrated that germ cell somatic mutations occur frequently throughout life, little is known about their distribution across sexually dimorphic tissues such as the breast and ovary. We examined gene expression patterns associated with germlines of both female and male breast carcinomas. Using microarray analysis, we identified 781 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 398 enriched in pathways related to DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. These DEGs were then assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples from 22 breast and 21 ovariectomy (OVX)-removed samples from human patients with breast cancer and normal control tissue. Of these 770 qRT-pcR results, 26 showed statistically significant correlations between DEG expression and clinico-pathologic parameters such as grade, stage, lymph node involvement, and hormonal therapy use. Among these, 13 were significantly predicted to be driver genes. This study identifies specific genes as drivers of germscanoma inbred mouse models and provides evidence for novel molecular biomarkers that could guide early detection of male carriers of germawnomics associated with increased risk of breast cancer.",

    "generated_answer": "Input: Hi Doctor, My name is Sarah and I'm 37 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in October of this year and I will be undergoing chemotherapy. After consulting with my doctor, they told me that there are many potential side effects associated with chemotheraphy which include hair thinning, fatigue, decreased libido, infertility, and infertilization, which can lead to an increased risk of birth defects. These risks were explained to me in detail and I understand the importance of being informed so that I make educated decisions regarding my health care needs. If you would like more information or assistance navigating these options, I encourage you to contact your doctor or the American Society of Plastic Surgeons directly. Additionally, it's important to note that while chemotherapeutics work to destroy tumor cells, it does not eliminate them entirely. Therefore, one should expect to experience side effects such as hair loss, fatigues, decreases in libido and fertilization rates.

Is there any effective solution available that can help me get rid of it permanently? Output: Hi Doc! Thanks for your input, here are some options you could try for treating your facial hairloss: 1. Surgery: Laser or scalpel surgery may remove excess hair follicles from underneath the skin, allowing new hair growth to start. However, this isn't always successful. 2. Hair transplant surgery: This is an invasive procedure where the surgeon removes small sections of hair folicles from the donor area(s), then implants them into bald areas. The process takes several hours, and recovery typically takes several weeks. 3. Topical treatments: There are various topical products available that contain ingredients such as minoxidil ( Rogaine ), finasteride , clotrimazole , or lithium oxyquinoline (Dermarest). These solutions can help regrow lost hair, but they aren't permanent, so maintenance care might still be necessary. 4. Hormonal therapies: If you are suffering from female pattern hair loss, hormones like estrogen and progesterone may contribute to hair loss. Your dermatologist can perform a hormonal analysis to determine whether you have hormone imbalances leading to hair fallout.com",

If you hear a clicking noise, call your podiatrist immediately.\n- Check your arch height with a measuring device such as an electronic toe-nail scanner. The measurement should be less than 3 mm measured between the second and third toes. If the reading exceeds that threshold, it could mean your feet are underdeveloped or too big.\nStep II: X-rays\nAn x-ray can show whether your arch is wide enough to support your foot. This condition is called flatfoot. Your podiatric surgeon will evaluate how much room you need around your foot to properly align your toes so they fit together correctly. They might suggest surgery to increase space in the foot.\nIf your arch looks normal on an x-rayed, then you don't have plantar fasciitis. You might still experience discomfort, though. Here are some steps to try next:\nStep III: Shoes and Orthotics\nYour podiatrics specialists might recommend shoes with added support. An orthotic device might also help alleviate pain. You should wear these devices only while sleeping.\nOrthotics are custom-made inserts designed specifically to improve the alignment of your footwear. Oral medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or antifungal agents aren’t effective treatments for plantarfasciitis because they target inflammation instead of the cause – your foot type.\nSome evidence-based studies show exercise to be helpful for treating plantar-fasciotomy, whichcorrection therapy\nDoctor orders\nChronic: hocalfusion\nBACKLOG:",

    "generated_answer": "Input: Hello Dr. This is a follow-on email regarding your previous discussion about my wife's postmenstrual bleeding pattern following her breast cancer treatment. We had discussed that she does seem to have an irregular period after completing her course of chemotheraphy and radiotherapy which started around January 27th. However, she has since experienced no significant bleeding despite multiple attempts at tracking her cycles using self-made charts and asking our gynecologist, who suggested that perhaps she might be having some form of delayed ovulation due to the high doses given to her. She has however noticed a slight increase in the number of her period-like symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal discomfort, mood swings etc. Since then, her blood work including Hb, LDH, ESR, lipid profile, hemoglobin values, urinary calcium excretion, BMI remain within normal limits and all routine lab results were normal too. My main concern here is whether she would experience similar recurrence if left untreated or is her postmenstral pattern something unique? It has come across to me that while you have mentioned that she should seek help immediately if there is any signs of heavy flow, can you elaborate more on how to interpret these periodic patterns accurately? Is it better to consider them as symptoms of reoccurrences or just coincidental events like menstrual cramps? Also, are there specific treatments available for delayed ovarian function that could potentially resolve her irregular periods? Your input will guide us well and it helps|assistant",

My name is [Your Name], residing at [City], state [State] since last six months, and working as a Sales Executive at [Company]. Since last month, I had noticed some slight discomfort in my left shoulder region which increased slightly every day. Initially, it felt like a small knot but soon became more intense, causing some pain. One evening while sitting at home watching TV, I suddenly fell off from my chair due to pain. I immediately rushed to the nearest hospital where I underwent CT scan, X-ray, and MRI. The results showed an extensive damage in my lungs leading to shortness of breath. As per the doctor's advice, I started taking antibiotics for ten days along with steroids. The first five days were quite effective, but then again, my condition deteriorated, and I got weak. Soon, I was unable to walk without assistance and could barely move around. After receiving a pulmonologist's opinion, I undertook a lung function test which revealed a significant reduction in oxygen saturation. Now, I seek your guidance on how to proceed next. Please suggest steps that would help me get better in terms of physical recovery. Also, please inform me about any potential long-term complications and how they might affect me in future. Thank You!",
