Also, I keep seeing blood in my urine which makes me scared of being pregnant, can you help me? Answer: Sure! Based on your statement that you are \"feeling weak and exhaustive\" and have experienced bleeding from urination, it sounds like you might be struggling with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Polycystics sufferers experience irregular periods, excessively high levels of insulin (due to an underactive pancreas), low levels of follicle stimulating hormones (FSH) or elevated levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and fatigue due to poor insulinaemia control. This could mean you are ovulating but unable to get pregnancies because of an imbalanced FSH/LH ratio, causing a condition known as polycystasis. It could also mean you have gestational diabetes, where your body produces too many insulins leading to a higher glucose count than normal, potentially causing extreme hunger and fatigues. Regardless of the cause of your unexplained symptoms, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms and establish a plan tailored to your needs. If you suspect polycistic infertility, such as a positive pregnantly you should speak with your fertilization specialists, they will work with information aboutxicryptogenital problemsomext fertility, Understandable huh oral andrologic hanging factors,ensey Insulin andfat",

    "generated_answer": "Based on your input, here's an updated version that includes additional information regarding your physical condition:\n\nNumbness and tenderness in the lower extremities are common in people who suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those with stage III renal failure. This condition can lead to severe joint damage, resulting in difficulty walking and standing. In some cases, these symptoms can be treated with conservative measures such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS), physical therapy, and supportive care measures. However, for more advanced cases of CKD or when nonmedical options fail, surgery may be necessary. In this scenario, you will require a consultation with one of our experienced nephrologists to discuss your specific case and determine the best course of action. We recommend keeping a journal of your symptoms, including the frequency and severity of your discomfort. Additionally, we would like to know whether you are able to perform activities of daily living without being unable to move freely or walking comfortably, regardless of the number of steps per day.

Your condition requires prompt attention because RA can cause severe joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. You should seek immediate medical help if your symptoms persist or get worse. The following are some common treatments for RA:\n\n1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These include ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac. NSAIDS can ease inflammation and improve joint mobility. Ask your healthcare provider how much of these drugs to start and how long to take them.\n   Advice for self care:\n   Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.

    "generated_answer": "The role of germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancers is well understood but the mechanisms underlying these differences between male and female germ cells remain poorly understood. While studies have demonstrated that germ cell somatic mutations occur frequently throughout life, little is known about their distribution across sexually dimorphic tissues such as the breast and ovary. We examined gene expression patterns associated with germlines of both female and male breast carcinomas. Using microarray analysis, we identified 781 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 398 enriched in pathways related to DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. These DEGs were then assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples from 22 breast and 21 ovariectomy (OVX)-removed samples from human patients with breast cancer and normal control tissue. Of these 770 qRT-pcR results, 26 showed statistically significant correlations between DEG expression and clinico-pathologic parameters such as grade, stage, lymph node involvement, and hormonal therapy use. Among these, 13 were significantly predicted to be driver genes. This study identifies specific genes as drivers of germscanoma inbred mouse models and provides evidence for novel molecular biomarkers that could guide early detection of male carriers of germawnomics associated with increased risk of breast cancer.",
