hello doctor I am months pregnant now before pregnancy I have been suffering through allergic rhinitis sneezing and dry coughing but as my pregnancy started I got a cough with white phlegm I wanted to avoid medicines during the first three months of pregnancy but due to late night coughing and phlegm I went to see a gynecologist at first she tried to control my cough through a mild cough syearup with ivy leaves but cough does not go away then my gynecologist asked me to visit a pulmonologist after a detailed checkup I was diagnosed with bronchial asthma he advised me to take budesonide with formoterol dry powder inhaler and montelukast sodium I am feeling better nowadays I do not have a cough now I do visit my gynecologist for a monthly checkup and she knows that I am taking dry powder inhaler for bronchial asthma this month my gynecologist advised me to take rejuva tablet that contains vitamin and it is a kind of nutritional supplement for bone health and fiore tablet for iron deficiency my he is nowadays my question is it safe to take iron tablets and nutritional supplements while taking bronchial asthma medicine I am afraid that may be due to iron I will get cough again secondly I am extremely worried due to the reason of diagnosing bronchial asthma in pregnancy I am taking medicine for asthma and I have heard it affect the unborn baby in terms of low birth weight but my asthma is under control due to this medicine and I am feeling much better nowadays I visit my gynecologist monthly for baby growth and she says it is perfectly fine note I cannot take dairy products citrus fruits and rice because I got cough and throat irritation due to bronchial asthma\n\nDOCTOR: hi you should continue bronchial asthma medicines as it is required to control your symptoms and to make you healthy if you do not take it then the effect on baby can be worse than while you are taking as baby growth is fine do not worry about it iron and calcium are also minimum requirements during pregnancy and if you do not take it and your he is down during delivery then it can be very dangerous if you bleed more so it is required during pregnancy and mostly it will not have any effect on bronchial asthma\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample

doctor my tooth filling came out when eating food tonight there is a hole in the bottom of where the remains of the tooth are and I can see bright pink through it gums around the tooth are not swollen or inflamed there is no pain when touching them either how likely is it that I can wait it out till my insurance kicks\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have read through your complaint and the relevant details do not worry because it is a root canal treated tooth there is no pain because during the root canal treatment the tooth pulp would have been cleaned thoroughly the pink color you see is the root filling material used since you have mentioned that your insurance starts from the est of the coming month you got to fill the hole where the filling was lost with some inert material the best choice would be sugarless chewing gum just chew one and pack it yourself with a blunt end of some spoon that can be easily grabbed at the kitchen drawers make sure you wash your mouth before you do this and also use cleaned spoons preferably disinfected in hot water for 15 minutes this can stay for a week time most probably when packed tight later on visit the dentist and get it filled with proper dental material I also advise you to get a crown for the root canal treated tooth as a next step through this you can get rid of the tooth filling breakage in case of heavy load the filling material has lost its strength as it stayed for 10 long years heavy chewing load ray to check any fractures of the tooth as a precaution follow up after three months\n\nSTATUS: medium
