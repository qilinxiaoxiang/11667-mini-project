Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I had wine and took corticosteroids during early days of pregnany will it harm my baby\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I am in week of my pregnancy and I am worried about some things that happened very early in the pregnancy before I knew I was pregnant I had a few glasses of wine from day to day 20 a total of six maybe and one glass and a half on day 20 I also took corticosteroids betamethasone a single dose of my due to an allergic reaction on day 20 and as if this was not enough I was also on antibiotics flucloxacillin which I finished on day 24 of pregnancy I am so afraid all of this might have had an impact on the baby is there a risk my baby might have been affected\n\nDOCTOR: hello as you have not mentioned the date of your last menstrual period I am assuming by day you mean the starting date of last menstrual cycle because we calculate the pregnancy age from that date so yes the early pregnancy time is very important because the embryo is developing in that time period so as per your query as you mentioned the consumption of wine in the early three weeks I do not think it is going to have any effect on the embryo because it is in the preovulatory phase when even the egg is being formed and released and yes corticosteroids in high doses when used for chronic medical conditions can have a risk of cleft lip and palate but a single shot taken for an allergic reaction should not be affecting the baby also the flucloxacillin is a penicillin group of drug which is usually safe in pregnancy so be calm and stop worrying about the risks it will just increase your stress levels moreover in early pregnancy if any embryo is grossly affected by any insult it either usually abort early if the exposure has been hazardous but if the exposure is nonhazardous it makes through and the baby will be fine this is called all or none phenomenon in pregnancy so your exposure to the medications was not that is something very dangerous so rest assured and more over your pregnancy has reached until weeks that is a good sign that the embryo has not been affected by the exposure to the drugs you have been worrying about please consult your gynecologist for your antenatal checkup and investigations required to be taken as per your local protocols us ultrasound for dating and viability it nuchal scan with dual marker test between 13 weeks routine antenatal investigations as per your local protocols tablet folic acid my daily once after food until 13 14 weeks avoid sexual

  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: my toddler has persistent fever and rash after mmr vaccination\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor my 15 month old daughter received her mmr vaccine days ago and since yesterday she has developed a high fever around 39 degrees celsius and today a pinkish rash appeared on her trunk and limbs she is still active and drinking fluids but I'm worried this might be something serious or a bad reaction to the vaccine should I be concerned about measles or is this normal after vaccination also she had paracetamol hours ago but the fever returned\n\nDOCTOR: hello what you are describing sounds like a typical reaction to the mmr vaccine which commonly occurs between 7 to 12 days after vaccination the fever and rash are expected immune responses as the body builds protection against measles mumps and rubella this is not actual measles but the body's way of developing immunity the fact that she remains active and is taking fluids is reassuring you can continue giving paracetamol every 4-6 hours as needed for fever control making sure not to exceed the recommended dose for her weight also ensure she stays well hydrated with breast milk formula or water the rash should fade on its own within 2-3 days without any treatment however if she develops difficulty breathing becomes lethargic refuses fluids or if the fever persists beyond 72 hours you should contact your pediatrician immediately for further evaluation otherwise this is a normal post-vaccination response and no emergency care is needed\n\nSTATUS: low severity",
