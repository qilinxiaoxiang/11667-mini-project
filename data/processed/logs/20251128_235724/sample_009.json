am freaking out because I want to get it cured as soon as possible to prevent damage to my ability to have children later in life unfortunately I am not able to get treatment from the nearby hospital for a couple of weeks I was wondering if there is another way to get the treatment sooner if possible the clinic offered free treatment but my peace of mind and less damage done is worth me paying for the prescription as long as I can afford it I just do not know where to go or if the clinic could fax the results somewhere thanks for the help\n\nDOCTOR: hi I can understand your concern chlamydia trachomatis is a sad sexually transmitted disease you have got the infection from your partner so you both should be treated ideally a vaginal swab test should be done to confirm the diagnosis you have not mentioned whether you have taken the test to confirm chlamydia infection first line agent for uncomplicated infection in non pregnant patient is ceftriaxone with azithromycin orally for one dose or doxycycline 100 my orally twice daily for seven days if you can share your vaginal swab test with cultural and sensitivity then I can suggest you the right treatment do not panic it will be

I get my periods regularly but this month I got my period as usual on the correct date and after one week again I got my period with lot of clots is this sign of menopause or all the cysts are coming out please advise how to become a mother in my case\n\nDOCTOR: hello doctor welcome to icliniq com age is an important factor in getting conception of an embryo the best healthy ovum are usually released during the early years of life thus during a late age we might have an unhealthy ovum so if you are trying to conceive you approach a gynecologist to check the status of your uterus endometrium ovary ovum and hormonal levels if there is something wrong we can specifically give the treatments mostly in this age menopause is possible other things such as fibroid uterus should be ruled out through an ultrasonogram if menopausal attained then the estrogen progesterone level in the blood will be in the lower level I suggest you go for a lab investigation to rule out the cause in allopathy system you may try for in vitro fertilization techniques for conceiving in ayurveda take tablet alles compounds two in the morning two in the afternoon and two in the evening after food continue this tablet for three months if you do not have fibroid uterus and menopause you will get conceived if a fibroid is there we can treat with other drugs or do surgery to remove the fibroid if

instructions to try and ensure accuracy over the past several days I have captured readings with extreme isolated spikes in diastolic pressure that coincide with my machine notifying a detectable irregular heartbeat and my diastolic pressure is normally within a very tight range however I am consistently getting readings that jump dramatically as high as 135 mhg when this occurs my systolic reading is not significantly affected from there I take a follow up measurement a minute later diastolic reading normally is lower but still greatly elevated to my normal range the first few times this has happened I ignored it but it is occurring more frequently over a period of several days otherwise I do not have any noticeable symptoms should I be concerned\n\nDOCTOR: hello I understand your concern and would like to explain that those abnormal diastolic be value spikes could be due to erroneous readings of automatic moron be equipment in the settings of episodic cardiac arrhythmia probably extrasystolic arrhythmia atrial fibrillation etc coming to this point probably it would be more appropriate to use a manual sphygmomanometer device several times and get an average value I would also recommend discussing with your attending cardiologist on the possibility of investigating your heart rhythm through an ambulatory egg electrocardiogram monitoring test hotter in addition thyearoid renal and adrenal function tests should be tested to rule out possible organ dysfunction I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium
