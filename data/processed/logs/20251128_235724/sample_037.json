1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: after doing some neck stretches my left shoulder went completely numb why\n\nPATIENT: hello I have been having symptoms for a long time now about years something constant that I feel is a pressure or imbalance on the upper left side of my body I get brainfog frequently other symptoms come and go sometimes my upper rib feels tight when inhaling sometimes I get dizzy and heart races palpates I have had some exams done recently and found out I have an inflamed supraspinatus tendon since that ive tried doing exercises and stretches but they have not helped that much I have even tried palpatine the tendon but it doesn't even feel tender recently I have tried doing some neck stretches and the next day my upper left shoulder went almost completely numb one thing I feel I have to mention is before these symptoms starting appearing I had an incident at the gym where I pushed too hard doing an exercise and something happened that my vision went dark and I had constant pain on shoulder neck area for a few weeks I apologize for the wall of text but I am at a standstill whatever this is it is keeping me from being able to function in everyday life I am currently a shell of my former self\n\nDOCTOR: hello after going through the detail you provided its clearly a symptom of jerk you felt at the gym while exercise I advice you to stop doing any exercise related to shoulder or neck take accelofenac paracetamol tablet twice a day fir days and consult in person with any physiotherapist near you need personal attention and proper treatment a physiotherapist will guide you during this time on how to perform exercise properly during pain and if needed he will apply ift and ultrasound to reduce pain and for relaxing muscles stay safe thank you\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: why do I get headache only when I am on computer or television\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor for a while I have been extremely sensitive to light and sun whenever I am in bright light or sunlight I get headaches or a migraine two weeks ago I developed migraine ever since then I have not been able to get on the computer to work as I get pressure in my head and headache I am fine when I am not on the computer or watching television now seeing computer or reading something on paper also causes this pressure and then result in headache my current medication is cloraz depot 75 my once daily please help\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have read your question with care and understand your concerns revert back with the detailed history to a neurologist online\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: does raised abc count mean leukemia\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am 24 a male recently I had some intense shoulder pain and a full panic attack I suffer from panic attacks and depression I went to the er and I had a 2100 total abc count chest ray abdominal ecography and urine tests all were okay the rest of the abc I believe was okay since the er doctor was not concerned and gave me some painkillers for the shoulder after day I went back because I was worrying for that high abc count and this time it was 1500 abc but again I did not see the rest of the abc and then I went back a week later and the abc was 750 with 38 lymphocytes 40 is the limit it says and platelets were 350 within normal rangeand the rest of the abc was normal clinically I feel good but as I have depression I cannot stop worrying about the abc and I am scared it might be leukemia I had a head it scan years ago and I read some inconclusive studies that it might slightly increase the chance of leukemia please if you can answer\n\nDOCTOR: hello this pattern in which abc has behaved does not fit into leukemia is an uncommon cause for abc elevation other common causes are infection steroids or any bodily stress can lead to this it not expected to go down in leukemia and counts are usually much higher than this also you are asymptomatic so does not appear like a leukemia to me you can get your count repeated after a week or so and also request to do peripheral smear to look for morphology of the cells so does not look like a worrisome to me hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format

  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: why does my stomach hurt after eating certain foods\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am 35 years old female for the past 6 months I have been experiencing abdominal discomfort and pain specifically after eating certain foods like dairy products bread and pasta the pain is usually crampy and located in my lower abdomen I also experience bloating and excessive gas sometimes diarrhea about 2 hours after meals I noticed this started after I had a course of antibiotics for a sinus infection I tried eliminating dairy for a week which helped a little but the symptoms returned when I ate pizza last weekend I have no weight loss no blood in stool and my appetite is normal I did some online research and wonder if this could be irritable bowel syndrome or maybe lactose intolerance but I am confused why bread would also cause problems I am getting really frustrated because I cannot enjoy meals with my family anymore and I am constantly worried about what I can eat\n\nDOCTOR: hello based on your symptoms it does sound like you might be dealing with either lactose intolerance or possibly non celiac gluten sensitivity the timing after antibiotics is significant as this can sometimes trigger changes in gut flora and lead to food sensitivities I would recommend you try a strict elimination diet removing both dairy and gluten completely for 2 weeks then reintroduce one at a time to see which triggers symptoms you could also try keeping a food diary to track specific foods and symptoms it would be good to consult with a gastroenterologist for proper evaluation they might recommend tests like lactose intolerance test or celiac disease antibodies test to rule out more serious conditions in the meantime you can take probiotics to help restore your gut flora and consider digestive enzymes before meals hope this helps guide you forward\n\nSTATUS: medium severity",

    "Doctor": "hello based on your symptoms it does sound like you might be dealing with either lactose intolerance or possibly non celiac gluten sensitivity the timing after antibiotics is significant as this can sometimes trigger changes in gut flora and lead to food sensitivities I would recommend you try a strict elimination diet removing both dairy and gluten completely for 2 weeks then reintroduce one at a time to see which triggers symptoms you could also try keeping a food diary to track specific foods and symptoms it would be good to consult with a gastroenterologist for proper evaluation they might recommend tests like lactose intolerance test or celiac disease antibodies test to rule out more serious conditions in the meantime you can take probiotics to help restore your gut flora and consider digestive enzymes before meals hope this helps guide you forward",
