1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: after chiropractic treatment for hiatal hernia I experience abdominal discomfort why\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor two months ago I was diagnosed with a very tiny hiatal hernia my chiropractor found my stomach is pushed up very high next to my esophagus he was able to push it back down but with a lot of painful force and manipulation ever since I have been getting sicker and sicker with episodes that are so debilitating that I can no longer work they happened occasionally at first but now three to four times each day always upon weakening and last for hours at a time it begins in my mid abdomen I feel and see pulsating in my abdomen and get a wet sensation as though the fluid is leaking out of my chest or belly if I push on that area or usually all by itself I get an instant rush of blood to my head and start to feel fuzzy my face turns bright red and becomes so hot that I get nauseous the redness sometimes stays sometimes goes away but what always follows immediately is intense heat throughout my whole body like my spine muscles and nerves are on fire everywhere from my head to my palms to my mouth to the soles of my feet then I start to shake uncontrollably with the shakes progressing into worse tremors in my left thigh and right biceps the shaking definitely seems to start from the abdomen or groin area if I press my thighs or groin or even touch them lightly my legs increase in spasticity when these episodes end I feel completely wiped out blurry vision and hard tired muscles but I never return to normal I always feel shaky and not myself I have been at the doctor twice when these episodes were happening the first time my be was a bit high at 130 mhg usually I am spot on at 120 80 mhg and the other time my vitals did not change at all during the episode other information possibly related my left thigh and knee are filled with fluid but my orthopedist attributes that to a popliteal cyst is that the same as an aneurysm he found behind my knee he gave me a cortisone injection four days ago but so far the swelling in the front of my thigh my knee and my calf have not gone down I was also told that I have an umbilical hernia and two inguinal hernias I also have a history of localized scleroderma which I understand can weaken the connective tissues and blood vessels recent blood tests for ana and rheumatoid factor both came back negative not sure how that is possible when I was diagnosed with a positive ana and localized scleroderma morphea 25 years ago I am very scared do you have any idea of what is happening to me or what tests I should have done not sure if this is gi related vascular rheumatology etc but I need to find a way to calm these spells so I can go back to work\n\nDOCTOR: hello welcome to icliniq com well the symptoms do sound a bit different and something we need to look into as per the issues I hope they have looked into any form of venous obstruction I super vein obstruction any compression on that vein can cause the face to turn red and a bit of low blood pressure but it is a very rare thing to happen a it computed tomography of the chest would be advisable to rule out this compression causing the symptoms but yes it does not explain what is happening in your legs the symptoms do see to be of hypersensitivity do these symptoms happen after a hot water bath as well do you feel any shock like sensation from the neck below for the popliteal cyst it is a bakers cyst it is totally different from aneurysm as aneurysm will be pulsating and moreover it is a very unusual site for it to happen normally it does respond to injection cortisone but sometimes if the injection does not go in the right place it can persist you may need to repeat the injection after a month or so incase it is persisting as for localized scleroderma it is a benign form and ana can go negative at times we can either call it a lab error or at times the body does act through to make it negative how much has been the skin extent in your scleroderma though to summarize we need to figure out a cause for your symptoms scleroderma does not explain it we need to see if it is an sec superior vena cava obstruction of the rarest cause with the spasticity happening in your legs on touching I would like to rule out any brain condition as well these sound like paroxysmal dyskinesia I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have pimples on my penis for the past several years with no pain please help\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I have pimples on my penis I do not feel any pain when I touch I just want them to dissappear I am having this for the past many months I was feeling shame to consult but now I do not want to take risk please help\n\nDOCTOR: hi I can understand your concern according to your statement you have been suffering from pimples on your penis for the past few months pimples can develop on the penis as they are common elsewhere on the body pimples are resulted from blockage of the sebaceous gland of the skin due to excess serum or debris or dead skin sebaceous glands excess secretion of oil serum can develop pimples for the prevention of pimples you should avoid excess sweat producing activities wear loose clothes for preventing them from friction take bath regularly and do not rub your affected area you can use topical retiniods salicylic acid benzoyl peroxide etc without any medications they are also disappeared with passing of time by keeping personal hygiene strictly\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: is there a chance for pregnancy even if hit was negative days back\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor it has been 27 days since I missed my periods my last period was almost two months back I was feeling sick and slight spotting was noticed for three days I had breast pain for more than eight days but now the pain has reduced 19 days back doctor said follicle is observed so periods may commence in a week time if not he advised me to go for a pregnancy test two days back I took a home pregnancy test hit turned out to be negative I am feeling very uneasy please help\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have read your problem for further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online\n\nSTATUS: medium
