  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what is the possibility of muscle twitch for a long period without any related symptoms to be als\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I was smoking weed for almost six years daily last july I stopped and then I started to have panic attacks with heart palpitation I went to a cardiologist and everything was fine but since then I became so anxious and I was aware of everything going on in my body after that I started to notice muscle twitching in every muscle at first I thought it was a heart issue but after seeing three cardiologists the results were the same my heart is fine then of course I googled it and I see some scary diseases like als I went to a neurologist who after some questions and examination said that it was due to an anxiety issue to be sure he sent me to an institute specializing in the detection of neuromuscular disease a neurophysiologist did a clinical examination strength reflex and an egg and no abnormalities was showed it were before three months a month later as my twitching was still going on I went to another neurophysiologist he did another egg and again everything was normal my neurologist said that it is impossible its als because muscle twitching for nearly eight months without any weakness and I started to have so tingling and buzzing sensation again my neurologist said that it is very common with an anxiety disorder like mine I started to take pills and to see a therapist for one month I have to say that twitching is way better when my anxiety is low but sometimes it came back strong I am so worried about als my questions are is egg test reliable is it true that usually fasciculations come after or along with the weakness in als fasciculation for eight months without any weakness does rule out als does als cause pain\n\nDOCTOR: hi I understand the problem you are facing it is partly due to anxiety and partly due to nerve and muscle hyperactivity coming to your specific questions yes fasciculations and weakness in als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis come together actually weakness comes first and fasciculations are generally unnoticed by patients they are usually revealed upon asking or found by egg electromyography egg is reliable and diagnostic for als fasciculations without weakness ruled out als eight months are a long duration for als if it would have been als it would have progressed to much extent and als is painless it is motor neuron disease so the sensory system is perfectly normal I would suggest you to try one tablet called carnisure plus contains levocarnitin 500 my and methylcobalamin 1500 micrograms it is a vitamin for muscle and nerves you can take it in the night daily for a few weeks and see the effect avoid coffee and other stimulants\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have sjogren syndrome with shortness of breath and increased heart rate what should I do\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor according to my doctor I have sjorgen syndrome my big issue is that at times I have shortness of breath and it comes and goes it used to happen not too often years ago but now it happens every other month last year I had to be hospitalized due to my racing heart which went to the 180 bum and no one knew the cause of it my pulmonologist prescribed me var and I take it daily my symptoms are starting again where I get so tired even to eat while sitting at rest what should I do\n\nDOCTOR: hello from your description it is clear that you have confirmed sjogren syndrome unfortunately it is a chronic autoimmune disorder and treatment options are very limited the treatment is only symptomatic and supportive in the sense that whatever symptoms you have we intend to alleviate those symptoms but no definitive treatment is effective in the long run as you said you experience shortness of breath on exertion it suggests that your airways and lungs are probably affected by the disease so it is our first aim to detect up to what extent is the lung involvement by doing various tests the characteristics of the disease is dryness of various mucous membranes and dryness of airways which leads to further symptoms like cough bronchitis or bronchiolitis and bronchial hyperresponsiveness pulmonary hypertension can set in the long run so keep watch on it by regular ad echo test of heart for pah pulmonary hypertension also keep watch on various complications of the disease corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment have shown some promise but it is not void of side effects var beclomethasone dipropionate inhaler will alleviate your cough and breathlessness but it is better if you take fluticasone plus formoterol inhaler twice daily along with spacer also taking levosalbutamol and ipratropium inhaler for emergency use is also advised immunosuppressive tablets like cyclosporine can be taken under your physician observation overall total treatment is symptomatic I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what to do for swollen and bleeding gums\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I had a cut in the gum after having some food later I garbled with listerine and it worsens the condition with swelling I am having bleeding gums while brushing I am 35 years old and I am diabetic please do the needful\n\nDOCTOR: hello for further doubts consult a dentist online\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about formatting]\nSTATUS: [low severity / medium severity / high severity]\n\nGenerate ONLY the new scenario, no meta-commentary.",
  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: persistent dizziness and balance issues after mild head injury\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor three weeks ago I slipped and hit the back of my head on a cabinet door I didn't lose consciousness but had a headache for a couple days I didn't go to the emergency room because it seemed minor but since then I've been having constant dizziness especially when turning my head or getting up from sitting position I feel like I'm on a boat and sometimes the room spins briefly I also notice I'm bumping into doorways and having trouble with balance when walking my primary doctor said it's probably just post-concussion syndrome and told me to rest but it's not getting better I'm worried about possible brain injury or something permanent I'm 42 years old with no significant medical history except occasional migraines\n\nDOCTOR: hello what you're describing sounds consistent with post-traumatic vestibular dysfunction which is common after even mild head injuries the symptoms you're experiencing - dizziness with head movement imbalance and that floating sensation - strongly suggest benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or possibly vestibular migraine exacerbation given your history the fact that you didn't lose consciousness is reassuring for more serious brain injury but persistent symptoms beyond two weeks warrant specific evaluation I recommend you see an ENT specialist or neurologist who can perform positional tests like the dix-hallpike maneuver to check for bppv which is easily treatable with specific repositioning maneuvers like the epley maneuver in the meantime avoid sudden head movements stay hydrated get adequate rest and consider vestibular rehabilitation exercises which can help retrain your balance system if symptoms worsen or you develop new symptoms like vision changes slurred speech or weakness seek immediate medical attention\n\nSTATUS: medium severity",
