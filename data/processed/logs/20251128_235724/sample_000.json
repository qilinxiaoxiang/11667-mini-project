Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I bled twice this month due to stress should I worry\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I have been extremely stressed lately I started a new job a couple of months ago I am going through a divorce and I have health issues pertaining to a brain surgery I had two years ago I had a normal pap smear last year my periods were normal until three months ago I was late by over a week for the past two months I got my period between 18 24 of last month I stopped and then again bled for a week from est to ith of this month this is the normal time I would have gotten it months ago now again a week later I am bleeding it started with dark brown blood that had tissue like small pieces in it and is now dark red going on day three my periods are always very heavy I always have ovary pain and bad cramps I had a section with my daughter and was told I have scar tissue during an exam I suffer from very painful periods when I sneeze or move or cough or stretch during ovulation and the beginning of my period I have a feeling like my right side is ripping apart why am I bleeding like this it has never happened to me before and I am scared it could be cancer I just had bloodwork I went to the hospital for an unrelated issue this week before the bleeding started and my red and white blood cells and normal abc workup was normal please help I am trying not to stress\n\nDOCTOR: hell first of all stop worrying we can take care of this stress can also play a vital role in hormonal functions so try to calm and relax yourself first see in general an average length of the menstrual cycle that is considered normal is 28 plus minus days so any deviation either before or after is abnormal coming to your present menstrual history you got early bleeding this time this mostly suggests some hormonal disturbance which needs to be evaluated it could be related to your thyearoid hormone or even a lifestyle related problem called cos polycystic ovarian syndrome but however any structural causes like polyps or fibroid also need to be ruled out for which ultrasound is required along with an examination by your gynecologist based on the past history it appears probably you must have had an entity called endometriosis or scar endometriosis in your cesarean scar this usually happens under the influence of the hormones that occurs in natural menstrual cycles when you are ovulating right now probably you did not ovulate either because of stress or due to the hormonal changes we need to evaluate I am suggesting a few tests that you need to take so that we can have a look into this meanwhile try to work on your lifestyle changes do regular exercises and take adequate dietary precautions avoid fatty or sugary or high carb junk foods all these measures will have beneficial effects on you try to meditate or do yoga for relaxation I would also like to know if you had any recent weight gain or weight loss any excess acne development or excess facial hair growth or scalp hair loss also if you have any headaches or visual changes it would be good if you could share the details of your recent ultrasound reports your scar tissue biopsy report if any done and the details of your previous issue which I am suspecting it to be endometriosis to guide you on the present problem the reports you shared show a good hemoglobin levels so nothing to worry in that ultrasound abdomen and pelvis complete hemogram lipid profile let liver function test rat renal function test 75 glucose tolerance test hba1c serum calcium vitamin b12 levels serum fasting and post prandial insulin levels serum fish follicle stimulating hormone oh leutinizing hormone free testosterone estradiol prolactin levels thyearoid profile to ash anti tpo on second or third day of next menstrual period hormonal imbalance cos polyp fibroid to be ruled out with ultrasound if the flow is heavy with passage of clots you can take tablet tragic 500 my thrice daily after food can avoid if the flow is normal yoga or medication maintain menstrual diary regular exercises at least one hour daily lifestyle and dietary modifications please revert back with the necessary details through chat preferably\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: after getting hot water flush my ear pain worsen is this ear infection\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I had an aorta aneurysm removed four weeks ago while in the hospital and rehabilitation I complained of my ear hurting I often collect ear wax so I thought that was the problem now that I am home and have a can and therapist helping me get stronger the ear pain is the only pain I have she put debrox and hylands earache drops in my ear she flushed the ear with warm water for two days the pain is so bad that I can hardly eat because chewing hurts it hurts in my mouth too I have been putting saltwater in but it does not seem to help might I have an ear infection I am not well enough to go to an ents office and I am not sure if they are open any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated\n\nDOCTOR: hello it is likely that you have developed otitis external following wax removal syearinging often leaves some moisture in the ear and this provides an ideal medium for fungi to grow in do you have pain while touching your tragus or moving your pina if you have severe pain then you may need analgesic it would be better to use paracetamol 500 tablet as and when required you can also use ear drops containing clotrimazole neomycin or ofloxacin beclomethasone and lidocaine eg candibiotic ear drops if there is visible swelling or redness of the ear canal you can also use a topical ointment like mupirocin cream with a tip twice or thrice a day hot fomentation around pina also helps in reducing pain and inflammation\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: prednisolone is the only solution for my rectal bleeding how long can I take it\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I am a 27 year old male for the past five years I have ulcerative colitis my main problem is bleeding form rectum when I take prednisolone I am fine for maximum of three months and after that again it starts bleeding and also continues with mesacol I also took azathioprine azoran but those medicines cannot stop bleeding only prednisolone is a solution for me what can I do and if I start taking prednisolone again is that any problem how many times in a year can I take prednisolone in five years I took prednisolone for 10 times please suggest solution\n\nDOCTOR: hello your history suggests that you have steroid dependent ulcerative colitis so you rightly started azathioprine and I think it should work if you are taking a proper dose you have not shared dose of azoran and your body weight you can take azoran as 5 5 my per keg body weight plus the dose of mesacol is also low increase the dose to at least 4 go day and you can go up to 8 go day maximum regarding frequency of steroid dosing you can take it up to twice per year in case of flare of your disease but it will be better to avoid it if you have a better option azoran because steroid has many long term adverse effects metabolite level of azathioprine complete blood count ear erythrocyte sedimentation rate steroid dependant ulcerative colitis tablet mesacol mesalazine 800 my thrice a day adjust dose of azoran according to metabolite levels avoid nsaids non asteroidal anti inflammatory drugs\n\nSTATUS: medium

  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: my 3 year old has had fever and rash for 4 days should I be concerned\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor my three year old daughter developed fever four days ago it started around 101 degrees fahrenheit I have been giving her paracetamol syrup which brings it down but it keeps coming back yesterday she developed a pink rash on her chest and back that seems to be spreading to her arms and legs the rash is not itchy and doesn't seem to bother her she is eating and drinking less than usual but still taking fluids she has been more tired and irritable than normal no vomiting or diarrhea but she did have a runny nose and mild cough at the beginning she attends daycare where several children have been sick recently I'm worried this could be measles or something serious as she hasn't completed all her vaccinations yet we missed her mmr vaccine due to the pandemic I checked her throat and it looks a bit red but no white spots her temperature right now is 100 2 after medication\n\nDOCTOR: hello from your description this sounds like a common viral illness in children rather than measles the fever lasting four days with subsequent rash development is characteristic of several childhood viral infections particularly roseola or other common viruses the fact that the rash appeared after the fever started and is non itchy makes measles less likely though we cannot completely rule it out without examination the decreased appetite and irritability are common with fever in children what's important is that she is still taking fluids and has no breathing difficulties or dehydration signs I would recommend you continue paracetamol for fever control and ensure adequate fluid intake you should monitor for these warning signs fast breathing more than 40 breaths per minute chest indrawing blue lips or tongue inability to drink or keep fluids down no urine for more than 8 hours or becoming lethargic or unresponsive if any of these occur seek immediate medical attention for now I suggest a video consultation with your pediatrician who can assess her properly they may want to check for strept throat or other bacterial infections that might require antibiotics if the fever persists beyond five days or she develops new symptoms we would need blood tests and possibly a throat swab maintain good hydration offer small frequent meals and use lukewarm sponging if fever is high most viral illnesses resolve on their own within 5 7 days\n\nSTATUS: medium severity",

    "Doctor": "hello from your description this sounds like a common viral illness in children rather than measles the fever lasting four days with subsequent rash development is characteristic of several childhood viral infections particularly roseola or other common viruses the fact that the rash appeared after the fever started and is non itchy makes measles less likely though we cannot completely rule it out without examination the decreased appetite and irritability are common with fever in children what's important is that she is still taking fluids and has no breathing difficulties or dehydration signs I would recommend you continue paracetamol for fever control and ensure adequate fluid intake you should monitor for these warning signs fast breathing more than 40 breaths per minute chest indrawing blue lips or tongue inability to drink or keep fluids down no urine for more than 8 hours or becoming lethargic or unresponsive if any of these occur seek immediate medical attention for now I suggest a video consultation with your pediatrician who can assess her properly they may want to check for strept throat or other bacterial infections that might require antibiotics if the fever persists beyond five days or she develops new symptoms we would need blood tests and possibly a throat swab maintain good hydration offer small frequent meals and use lukewarm sponging if fever is high most viral illnesses resolve on their own within 5 7 days",
