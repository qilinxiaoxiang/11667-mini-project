Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: should I visit a doctor for my lying behavior\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor my mom wants to take me to a doctor because she thinks I need help but I told her I am fine and refused to go I started to wonder whether I really do have a problem she started telling me I needed help because I would just lie about something stupid instead of telling the truth also how I could just stop caring about anything another thing I would do is just pretend fake happiness about something that I really did not care about I also started to care more about how I look and try to look perfect but I do not have any one to impress I just feel like if I do not look perfect something is wrong if you have any ideas about what is happening I would love to know thank you\n\nDOCTOR: hi for further doubts consult a psychiatrist online\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: does spotting on birth control pills indicate its ineffectiveness\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor does spotting on birth control mean your pill is not being effective\n\nDOCTOR: hi how are you doing spotting in between cycles when you are regularly taking birth control pills means that the endometrium or the inner lining of the uterus is not being fully supported by the hormones if you are not punctual on taking pills or had vomited immediately after taking the pill then that will be the problem so you have to make it a point to take the pill regularly preferably at the same time every day if you are taking low dose pills then the dose is insufficient so you have to switch to the higher dose pills component of ethinyl estradiol in the pill of 30 mug is a high dose and good for these spotting instead of the 20 mug pills if you have been putting up weight recently hormones may be insufficient for that new weight I hope pregnancy had been ruled out before starting the pills and local factors like polyps or fibroid projecting into the uterine cavity have been ruled out by ultrasound scans of the pelvis local factors like spotting or discharge from the cervix especially after sex need a local examination and treatment if all possibilities have been ruled out then just give support of tablet estradiol valerate my progynova two tablets a day until the day of periods this will support the lining and spotting will stop in a day or two\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: will urinary output increase with be medicine\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor before two months I had one stent

prescribed drugs these were aspirin 75 my amlodipine 10 my atorvastatin 80 my bisoprolol 25 my ticagrelor 90 my it has been eight weeks I felt a great minus few chest giggles presumed this was stent

every two to three minutes my doctor is thinking I have a ti despite being negative for it now they are testing me for gonorrhea and chlamydia my suspicions are that the drugs I am taking causing this I feel like stopping them all together or having the dosage I cannot see my cardiologist until next year is there a link between my drugs and these symptoms and am I safe to temporarily stop a few of them to rule them out if so which ones are crucial and which are not I am eternally grateful for your help\n\nDOCTOR: hello all the medicines you are taking are essential medicines and should not be stopped except in case of severe allergy none of these medicines cause increased urination amlodipine is a blood pressure lowering medicine it can be changed to some other medicine this medicine may cause fluid retention and swelling of feet in some patients regarding increased urination possibilities include maybe you are taking medicines called water pills or diuretics which are sometimes given in heart patients these increase urine output please review your medicines ti urinary tract infection may cause increased urination raised be itself may cause increased urination keep be blood

  "api_response": "================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: can anxiety cause physical chest pain and shortness of breath\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor for the past three weeks I have been experiencing sharp chest pains that come and go mostly on the left side along with feeling like I cannot take a deep breath properly I went to the emergency room last week where they did an ECG chest X-ray and blood tests all of which were normal I have no history of heart problems and I am only 28 years old my primary doctor says it might be anxiety but I am worried because the pain feels very real and physical I have been under a lot of stress at work recently with deadlines and my sleep has been poor waking up multiple times at night I do not have any coughing fever or swelling in my legs could anxiety really cause such intense physical symptoms and should I seek further cardiac testing or focus on anxiety management\n\nDOCTOR: hello yes anxiety can definitely cause the physical symptoms you are describing including chest pain and shortness of breath this is often due to muscle tension hyperventilation or increased sensitivity to bodily sensations when you are stressed or anxious your body releases stress hormones that can lead to these symptoms since your ECG chest X-ray and blood tests were normal at the emergency room it is unlikely that there is a serious cardiac issue however if you have risk factors like family history of heart disease at a young age or if the pain occurs with exertion rather than at rest further evaluation might be considered for now I would recommend focusing on anxiety management techniques such as deep breathing exercises regular physical activity improving sleep hygiene and possibly speaking with a therapist or counselor about stress reduction if symptoms persist or worsen follow up with your primary doctor to rule out other causes like gastroesophageal reflux or musculoskeletal issues\n\nSTATUS: low severity",
