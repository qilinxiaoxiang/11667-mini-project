  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: underwent bladder surgery before 20 years but could not control urine sometimes why\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor my brother having a problem when he was years old he underwent an operation in the bladder I have attached all the summary for your reference now he is 25 years old still he cannot control the urine for sometimes could you please suggest what we can do for this please help\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have read through your query in detail please find my observations below your brother was treated for a tethered cord with a lipoma in close proximity to the cord at the sacral region it means that he had a fat containing tumor in the lower end of the spinal cord these are birth and developmental problems that cannot be completely treated at 25 years of age he can get another mri magnetic resonance imaging scan of lower back done and discuss it with a neurosurgeon if there is any persisting area where there is pressure on the spinal cord or the nerves usually if any pressure effect on the nerves or cord is present now then they can think of releasing the pressure and this might improve his symptoms if his condition is not possible to be treated after discussing and doing an mri scan then the only way is to pass urine at regular intervals and avoiding an over distended bladder\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what causes pain in the extracted tooth area with bone exposure that extends unto ear\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I had a root canal done three months ago on tooth 19 I have not had a crown done yet due to financial reasons I went to a new dentist for tooth pain in that area and he said he could not help me because the rays showed the root canal was not finished I called my endodontist back and they basically refused to see me back and said they did complete the root canal and the reason they did not fill one of the roots was for post space well my rays have been reviewed by an oral surgeon and another endodontist in the meantime who have all concluded that the root canal does not look complete as one of the roots is not filled with the filling material that is used it was also determined that tooth 18 needed a root canal but was not going to be certain to work and I may end up losing that tooth for financial reasons I opted to have tooth 18 pulled five days ago in hopes of helping the severe tooth jaw and ear pain that I am having it did not work I am still having the pain and to complicate matters I now have bone exposure on the tongue side of where my tooth was extracted I saw the surgeon yesterday and he filed it down my headaches are ridiculous and of course I worry the infection is spreading to my head I have had three recent sinus surgeries and this does not feel the same I have been on amoxicillin for over a week now but my tooth pain in 19 has increased since the extraction do you have any suggestions I am currently taking amoxicillin and norco\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have read through your complaint and the relevant details and also saw the ray you have attached tooth number 19 seems to have a good apical seal in the root fillings the first dentist was right in saying that there is a space prepared for the post fixture there is one cusp missing in the tooth hence the treatment plan was a post and core followed by a crown the pain is definitely not because of this root canal treated tooth the reason behind this is that only poorly cleaned prepared or poorly filled roots retain the bugs to stay within the roots while deteriorating the tooth and give pain in your case the root fillings are excellent since you told you are not able to get a crown due to financial reasons at the moment the treatment plan could have been changed maybe at least the post could have been fixed leaving the crown fabrication at the last in that case at least the tooth stays stronger for a while and does not break off when you bite hard food next regarding the tooth extracted area you have mentioned that the bone is exposed now I doubt if you have got dry socket not to be mistaken for infection due to improper healing of the gums over there this might be the reason for the severe pain secondly tooth number 20 also has decay on the sides which makes me to advise you to get another ray for that tooth the current ray does not show the complete tooth this particular tooth might also be the reason for pain please do not worry that the infection spreads to the head there is no such possibility for that right now either 18 dry socket or 20 decay has to be addressed to help you get rid of the pain continue taking amoxicillin as prescribed and for pain relief you can switch to ibuprofen 400 my orally eight hourly for two days provided you do not have asthma or gastritis problems else continue narco tablet for two more days hence I advise you to visit back to the dentist and get done with further checkups as I mentioned above periapical ray for tooth number 20 to rule out interproximal cares pulpits in 20 saline irrigation and zinc oxide eugenol dressing for dry socket in 18 gargle mouth with lukewarm saltwater thrice daily for three days to flush out debris from the gums and in the extracted socket in case it not healed yet follow up after three weeks\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have a few medium sized pimples on my penis for about a few days what could it be\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I have a few medium sized pimples on my penis it was only one pimple a few days ago but now it has grown to four I have started drinking garlic water after watching few suggestions on youtube\n\nDOCTOR: hi welcome to icliniq com according to your description there are multiple things that could present as such it could be molluscum contagiosum genital warts or herpes sometimes even physiologic changes such as pearly penile papeles can also present like this if you are sexually active it could be an sad sexually transmitted disease as well kindly revert to me with photos and sexual history so as to aid in diagnosis and treatment\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique
