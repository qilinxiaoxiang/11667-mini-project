  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what are the recommended options for av fistula placement\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor this query is for my father in law aged he is 58 years old and is diabetic and currently under medication for be also he has a history of two major heart attacks in the last five years he did not have any major heart issues recently due to extensive amount of medications taken for a long time he started showing signs of high amount of creatinine currently 9 we did a few dialyses now doctors have advised doing an av fistula on his left hand his left hand is partially amputated from a previous septic shock treatment about four years back his right hand is fine but an av fistula there might terribly limit his movements and self care we wanted a medical opinion about where the fistula can be placed or can it be near to chest area as an alternate option\n\nDOCTOR: hi there are three main types of auf arteriovenous fistula the radiocephalic fistula is a forearm fistula created by anastomosing the side of a radial artery to the end of a cephalic vein it is also referred to as the brescia cimino fistula the brachiocephalic fistula is an upper arm fistula created by connecting the side of a brachial artery to the end of a cephalic vein or slightly central to the level of the elbow finally the brachial arterytotransposed basilica vein btb fistula is another upper arm fistula this fistula is created by anastomosing the side of a brachial artery to the end of a basilica vein that has been transposed laterally and elevated superficially to make it amenable to dialysis cannulation other sites could be leg also I advise you to discuss it with your doctor the patient requires dialysis for sure or you can put a central line and replace it every 15 to 20 days but av fistula is the best option\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have a sore throat for more than two weeks even after taking antibiotics why\n\nPATIENT: i have a sore throat for more than weeks now and I am done taking antibiotics dalacin for days but it is not going away I feel that there is something stuck inside my throat esophagus I have a mild headache but no fever pain scale is ranging 6 out of ten I also gargle every hours using difflam gender age 36 it 1 wt 191 labs\n\nDOCTOR: if this got worse after antibiotics it is likely thrush a yeast infection of the throat often found after antibiotic and or steroid treatment see if you can get your physician to prescribe fluconazole 150mg daily 10 days not days like prescribed for female yeast infections this would not be long enough if it got much better after the antibiotic and has stayed level you might consider that whatever bacteria you had was partially resistant and another should be tried a good one to consider if you have not had this yet is clindamycin 450md three times a day 10 days if you have had that already consider amoxicillin clavulinic acid 875mg twice a day 10 days if none of these are the case see an ent to rule out an abscess behind the tonsil know as a peritonsillar abscess or some other cause\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: how can spinal compression fracture be cured\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor months back had a spinal compression fracture of the t12 vertebrae caused by a large fall into water currently it is stable meaning I can walk and move no gross deformity I have motor and sensory function within normal limit I have aggravated pain when I bend forward or sit or stand for longer than 10 minutes but I can walk around without pain it is basically just a bone in my spine that is squashed to around 70 of its height and is pressing on the spinal nerve most fractures like this heal in a few months but mine never healed I saw a few different doctors which told me a few different things I got rays and a it scan I would like an opinion on the best non invasive treatment\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have seen your it scan and rays it has been sometime now since you got the injury and I would not expect any more soft tissue or bony healing now suggesting non invasive treatment now would only comprise of daily physiotherapy and extension exercises you need to strengthen your muscles to take the load of the body and reduce load taken by the spine suggesting any invasive stabilization procedure to you would require looking at mri scans rather than it scan but your options unfortunately are limited interns of non invasive management based on physiotherapy only I would not even recommend braces for you mri if ready for invasive stabilisation procedure none as above physiotherapy as of now as wished and required by patient\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about formatting]\nSTATUS: [low severity / medium severity / high severity]\n\nGenerate ONLY the new scenario, no meta-commentary.",
  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: what causes persistent dizziness when standing up\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am a 45 year old female experiencing dizziness when I stand up from sitting or lying position for about 3 months now it happens every single time I stand up I see black spots and feel like I might faint the episode lasts for about 30 seconds then gradually improves I have checked my blood pressure during these episodes and my systolic drops from 120 to 90 I have no other significant medical history except mild anemia for which I take iron supplements I don't take any other medications I drink plenty of water and eat regular meals I'm concerned because this is affecting my daily activities and I'm afraid I might fall\n\nDOCTOR: hi what you're describing sounds like orthostatic hypotension which is a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down there are several potential causes including dehydration anemia medications neurological conditions or autonomic nervous system dysfunction given your history of anemia I would first ensure your iron supplements are adequate and your hemoglobin levels are optimal I recommend increasing your salt intake slightly if you don't have hypertension and ensuring you're drinking at least 2-3 liters of water daily try rising slowly from seated or lying positions and consider compression stockings to help with blood return if symptoms persist you should see a cardiologist or neurologist for further evaluation including tilt table testing to confirm the diagnosis and rule out more serious conditions\n\nSTATUS: medium severity",
