Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: every day I feel intense disgust for humanity and people what can be done\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor every day I feel intense disgust for humanity and people I struggle with sadism and my last girlfriend broke up with me because that went too far it has always been a problem in relationships for me I hate society so much every time I see a person I want to torture them brutally every house I walk by I want to just kick the door down I just hate them all I do not even value my own life I am nothing I feel like I was just born for this born wrong born to be a problem I tried to fight it too and I failed no matter how much I tried to control it even when professionals were involved it overpowered me and ruined what little good was in my life I am no immediate danger of hurting people but I think one day I am going to really snap I have built up an intensive library of bad experiences with people and I do not think I can take much more people repulse me now is there any hope for people whose brains are as warped as mine I am 31 and I struggle to even hold down a job because I find I get emotionally exhausted doing things I do not actually want to do I also have a destructive temper so that causes trouble at work too what do I do I have been through the emotions you are only another psychiatrist so I do not know what I am expecting in reaching out again how can I break the cycle if therapy or medicines and psych wards have not helped me I have already tried taking my own life three times\n\nDOCTOR: hi I can imagine how hard it is for you right now anger hatred past traumas and experiences consume us all in your case it has gone a little too far but the fact that you have reached out even after trying everything is enough for me to see hope and tell you that yes there is still something that can be done change is hard and it takes huge amounts of strength and struggle but if you have decided that you need to get out of this situation and you are willing to do anything for it then no one can stop you I would suggest you to first ask yourself how determined are you for a change if this is just another call to check if things can work and you yourself have doubts then surely you will fail and everything you try will fail as well if you decide that you will find a way out then no one can stop you I would suggest starting therapy sessions regularly with a psychotherapy expert if you cannot find one then you can opt for online therapy sessions with me first you need to vent out and learn to let go of past traumas it will be hard and will take time but until and unless you do that you cannot move forward once you are there that is when we can focus on building new perspective and living a good life again telling you it will be really hard but it is possible so find a local therapist or opt for a video consultation and we can talk I hope this helps take care\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample
