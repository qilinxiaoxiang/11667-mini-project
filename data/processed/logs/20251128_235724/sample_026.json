manifestation of allergic rhinitis the total ice in serum is just an indication of the allergy status at the time of taking the blood sample it is not very significant in allergy practice nevertheless it shows that you have an allergy you need some medicines to keep allergy under wraps and prevent the blockage and cold you also need to find out which allergen is offending and causing the problems the best way to diagnose is getting a skin prick test done at a good allergy diagnostic lab meanwhile you will be benefitted by an antihistaminic with leukotriene inhibitor combination steroid nasal spray and allergen avoidance you would need to be taking these for about two to three months allergen avoidance is the best solution could you provide us more details about the complaints so that we can guide you better is the problem seasonal or perennial does it only occur in the nights when you lie down under the fan or any time of the day does it get worse in winters or when you visit any hill station where do you live do you smoke what is your diet like do you get exposed to vehicular exhaust pollution or smoke and dust of any kind have you tried nasal sprays before is the cough wet

I would be grateful for your help\n\nDOCTOR: hi welcome to icliniq com failure can make you feel nervous and a little less of ourselves but understand that your self worth does not depend on exam results everyone has their own strength and weaknesses you too are good at something and bad at others clearly you are under a lot of stress I would suggest you talk to someone you can trust and share your feelings also I would recommend talking to a counselor psychologist or therapist they will help you with coping up with stress and anxiety and teach you techniques to have better control on yourself and also you can learn some study techniques which will help you perform better again remember you are not your exam results I am sure you have amazing potential you just need to find out what you are good at and become the best version of yourself\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample

my ear I can feel hear it making a crackling wet noise when I push my jaw forward or a painful pushing feeling inside my ear when I clench my teeth it started yesterday and is better now that I have slept and it is relaxed but it is still bothering me and the crackling pushing is still there\n\nDOCTOR: hi for a taj dysfunction you can consider the following advice spasm in the muscles around the joint can be the reason for this probable dysfunction it will take around weeks for the muscle to get back to normal but chiefly depends on how much precautionary measures mentioned above you have
