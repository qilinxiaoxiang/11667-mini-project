  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: I have persistent dizziness when standing up suddenly\n\nPATIENT: Hello doctor I am a 32 year old female experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness whenever I stand up quickly from sitting or lying position. This has been happening for about 3 months now and sometimes I feel like I might faint. The dizziness lasts for about 10-15 seconds then gradually improves. I don't have any hearing problems or ear pain. I did check my blood pressure at home and it was 110/70 when sitting and dropped to 90/60 when standing. I'm otherwise healthy and take no medications. Could you please advise what might be causing this and what I should do about it?\n\nDOCTOR: Hello what you're describing sounds like orthostatic hypotension which is a form of low blood pressure that occurs when standing up from sitting or lying down. The sudden drop in blood pressure reduces blood flow to your brain causing the dizziness symptoms. This can be caused by dehydration anemia or autonomic nervous system issues. I recommend you increase your fluid intake to at least 2-3 liters daily and add more salt to your diet unless you have hypertension. When getting up do it slowly - sit first for a minute then stand. Compression stockings might help improve blood return from your legs. If symptoms persist after two weeks of these measures please consult for blood tests to check for anemia thyroid function and electrolyte levels. You might need a tilt table test to confirm the diagnosis if simple measures don't help.\n\nSTATUS: low severity",
