gastric upsets after a course of antibiotic and antibiotic like augmenting are notorious to cause this occur secondary to effect of augmenting on decreasing the amount of lactobacillus microorganism which are normally present in the human gut and help digest the food you should take yougurt kefir fermented yougurt kefir and there are certain diets with probiotic activity you can start taking it

change of weather I have been having trouble sleeping lately since I am very uncomfortable right now I am using cetaphil gentle wash and shampoo because my scalp gets itchy as well I am using erica ointment and somehow it helps me with some of the areas that are not really that worse however the uncomfortable feeling is still there sometimes I take antihistamines however I do not think that it

labs and I am 1 I also have an irregular menstrual cycle and I usually get my period every quarter I have asthma and I am currently taking seretide inhaler as prescribed by my doctor please help\n\nDOCTOR: hi atomic dermatitis is relatively more sort of relapsing with seasonal aggravation it has a genetic and familial component as well if you have severe symptoms which is hampering your daily activities you need to start with systemic immunosuppressants like prednisolone and or azathioprine erica ointment I mometasone is good enough for skin lesions but I would rather add on tacrolimus gel 1 over the inflamed lesions but you need to use moisturizer very frequently than previous you need to take antihistamine on a daily basis reduce your stress avoid wool and strong soaps practice wet wrap therapy I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical
