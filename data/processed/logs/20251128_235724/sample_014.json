pain in my shin there is one spot that in particular hurts it hurts no matter what I am doing the pain started when I started jumping rope yesterday earlier in the week I started doing snatches for the first time and I may have not had proper form I have now stopped the only time I get some relief is when I put ice on it and the pressure that the ice packs give help a bit the pain is only in my left leg on the bottom half sometimes the pain moves into my foot in the area on the foot bone between my big toe and second toe my height is 6 and I weigh about 140 keg\n\nDOCTOR: hello from your description the likelihood of a stress fracture is minimal unless you are grossly vitamin deficient there is a good chance this is tendinitis or periostitis which are both inflammatory conditions as that arise in the tendon and lining of the bone respectively the fact that rest and ice help favors the above two conditions I suggest that you stop skipping at the moment take said non asteroidal anti inflammatory drugs as available ice the area regularly three to five times a day and see how you are at the end of next week if pain is better then gradually return to physical activity if no improvement then seek professional help for a complete examination and suitable blood tests\n\nSTATUS: low

than occasional ectopic beats and episodes of tachycardia ranging from 100 160 recently my ectopic beats have been a lot more intense by this I mean that I get a very large thud in my chest that makes me feel abit giddy and shook up I have been to the doctors but nothing has come of it I suffer with chronic anxiety but feel I am not loving my life because of this and the constant tachycardia could you give me some advice\n\nDOCTOR: hello your reports appear to be fine other than ectopic and probably sinus tachycardia which are benign you should get your thyearoid test and hemoglobin level done if not done recently you should assure yourself that these are benign and will not cause any harm you need to discuss with your doctor regarding withholding salmeterol or use it to the minimum it can cause or aggravate these also coffee intake should be minimized and if symptoms are too troublesome then you should discuss with your doctor regarding starting betablockers or calcium channel blockers which would subside these if not contraindicated in you\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample

  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: persistent lower back pain with leg numbness after gardening\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I've been having this nagging lower back pain for about three weeks now that started after I spent a weekend doing heavy gardening the pain is mostly on the right side of my lower back and sometimes shoots down my right leg all the way to my foot I've noticed some numbness in my right foot especially between my first and second toes when I wake up in the morning my back feels very stiff and it takes me about 30 minutes to be able to move properly the pain gets worse when I sit for long periods or try to bend forward I'm a 52 year old male who works as an accountant so I sit at a desk most of the day I've been using heat packs which help temporarily but the numbness concerns me\n\nDOCTOR: hello from your description this sounds like it could be a lumbar disc issue possibly with nerve root compression given the radiating pain and numbness the specific numbness between your first and second toes suggests possible L5 nerve root involvement which is common with disc problems at that level the morning stiffness could indicate some inflammation as well I would recommend you avoid heavy lifting and prolonged sitting try to take frequent breaks from sitting to walk around gentle stretching may help but avoid any movements that increase the pain you can continue with heat therapy and consider over the counter anti inflammatory medications if not contraindicated for you if the symptoms persist beyond another week or if the numbness worsens or you develop weakness in your leg you should see your doctor for proper evaluation which may include imaging studies like an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions\n\nSTATUS: medium severity",

    "Doctor": "hello from your description this sounds like it could be a lumbar disc issue possibly with nerve root compression given the radiating pain and numbness the specific numbness between your first and second toes suggests possible L5 nerve root involvement which is common with disc problems at that level the morning stiffness could indicate some inflammation as well I would recommend you avoid heavy lifting and prolonged sitting try to take frequent breaks from sitting to walk around gentle stretching may help but avoid any movements that increase the pain you can continue with heat therapy and consider over the counter anti inflammatory medications if not contraindicated for you if the symptoms persist beyond another week or if the numbness worsens or you develop weakness in your leg you should see your doctor for proper evaluation which may include imaging studies like an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions",
