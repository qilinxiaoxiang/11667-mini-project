Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: my penis erects only on the left side and refrains to stay erect why\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I think I have a certain level of erectile dysfunction my penis becomes hard but only from the left side and refrains from staying erect what is the remedy for this situation\n\nDOCTOR: hello I can understand your concern if there is poor erection on one side then this cannot be ignored this could be due to some vascular issues have you got any injury during sexual intercourse in the recent past or sudden bending during masturbation is there any history of hypertension or diabetes please provide the details in the followup\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: please give your opinion regarding bullet injury of my relative\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor my family relative got shot yesterday as of right now he still has the bullet inside the bullet went in through his left ear and did not come back out I am not sure exactly where inside the bullet is he is currently hospitalized but no doctor has come up with a solution my relative is in severe pain to the point where he starts to shake I would like a second opinion and want to know what a doctor would do\n\nDOCTOR: hi for further information consult an internal medicine physician online\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have ulcers sore throat and oral thrush with swallowing difficulty please help\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am a year old female I have some mouth and throat concerns I have ulcers sore throat occasional oral thrush difficulty swallowing lump on the throat larynx night sweats fever loose teeth and abnormal discoloration in mouth I am currently on birth control patch dextro amphetamine and cymbalta I have been struggling for months now with quite a few mouth and throat issues I have constant mouth ulcers that are taking weeks to heal I get the sensation that I have not swallowed something completely down and that it stuck so I will keep swallowing and swallowing it drives me mad it is not easy for me to keep doing this because swallowing feels harder than it should be almost like my throat is too swollen I have a sore throat 80 of the time I have odd waves of oral thrush and my mouth also has pale and red areas on my soft palate my hard palate is just very pale I have a couple of loose teeth but otherwise in very good shape frequent random nose bleeds that are usually heavy but can be light at times night sweats every night and feeling easily overheated during the days I have also now become more concerned since my throat developed a hard lump on the top of my larynx it feels very swollen where it is almost like it is ready to explode it does not move and it stays firm putting a lot of pressure on my throat I am assuming this is why it feels hard to swallow it does not hurt but if I push on it to feel the firmness it causes discomfort to the surroundings mostly underneath the lump\n\nDOCTOR: hi first and foremost I would advise you not to panic or get disheartened according to me there is no major issue out there and we usually encounter such issues very often in our outpatient department now looking at your case oral ulcers can be due to various causes right from nutritional and vitamin deficiencies to infections or repeated trauma getting each and every parameter tested often becomes extremely expensive and might frustrate you even more coming to your second major concern difficulty in swallowing with no major pain as such can be due to some ulcers down in your throat or infection in your pharynx throat or constant gastric irritation advice consider taking a good multivitamin for two to three months follow a healthy hygienic lifestyle avoid smoking alcohol etc avoid having spicy oily and junk food items salt water gargles at least to 10 times a day you should keep your oral cavity free from contaminating organisms and hence the throat infection keep sipping on boiled warm water consider antireflux therapy if you have the slightest of reflux issues get your viral markers for hiv hbsag and blood sugars done too do not google too much of your symptoms out 10 do not correlate too many unnecessary things and do not take stress at any cost sometimes stress can be responsible for non healing ulcers\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about formatting]\nSTATUS: [low severity

  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: persistent lower back pain with leg numbness after lifting heavy objects\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am a 35 year old construction worker and I've been having severe lower back pain for about three weeks now it started after I lifted some heavy equipment at work the pain is constant and radiates down my right leg with tingling and numbness in my foot I've tried over-the-counter painkillers and heat pads but nothing seems to help the numbness is getting worse and sometimes my foot feels weak when I'm walking I'm worried this might be something serious because I can't perform my job properly anymore\n\nDOCTOR: hello I understand your concern this sounds like it could be a disc-related issue possibly sciatica given the radiating pain and neurological symptoms like numbness and weakness it's important to get this properly evaluated I would recommend you see an orthopedic specialist or neurologist for a thorough examination they will likely order an MRI scan to visualize your spinal discs and nerves in the meantime avoid heavy lifting and sudden bending movements you might find some relief with proper back support and gentle stretching exercises but please don't self-medicate beyond basic pain relief\n\nSTATUS: medium severity",
