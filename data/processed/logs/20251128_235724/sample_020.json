Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: how to stop heroin safely during pregnancy\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor my niece is pregnant and taking subutex she just confided to me that she has also been using heroin along with subutex for the last one month she is afraid to ask her primary care doctor for advice her doctor told us in the beginning that it is more harmful to the fetus if the mother were to abruptly quit using opiates now my niece is afraid to stop the heroin use even though she also has the subutex which I thought is supposed to help with this type of situation how can she safely stop using heroin can she continue her regular dose of subutex daily and just cut out the heroin all together at once\n\nDOCTOR: hi for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I get bad odor from mouth and nose could it be due to leaky gut or candid\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor for a while now I have had a terrible odor that comes out my mouth and nose the odor is somewhat subtle whenever I am not around a fan ac etc but whenever I am around one of those the smell seems to spread all around me I am positive the smell is coming from inside my stomach I have realized a lot about leaky gut and candid but neither one mentions a smell my diet before has been poor lots of packaged sugary foods but I have always been a healthy weight I feel terrible riding in a vehicle with others I will sometimes hold my breath to try and stop the smell but it does not work most of the time my symptoms started when I was a working nightshift job stress might have been a factor although I did not feel like I was I have not worked there for almost six months and my condition has worsened could the amount of sugar I consumed destroyed my stomach lining I also heard when candid is starved it digs into the lining and essentially makes holes which can cause food to leak could this be the source of the smell I am currently taking probiotics\n\nDOCTOR: hi welcome to icliniq com there is nothing like leaking gut in the medical dictionary the bad breath you are experiencing in medical terms is called halitosis it is majorly because of poorly kept oral hygiene it could be an indicator of gum infection tooth decay smoking alcohol etc sometimes it is because of organized infection of tonsils my suggestion is to consult a dentist first to find out the cause as in the majority of patients it is related to the oral cavity the remedy is simple maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice daily in your case after every feed do regular flossing avoid smoking and alcohol if you do so you can use flavored mouthwashes regularly which are easily available with chemists\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: how to cure the acne breakouts\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I have had good skin for all my life people would even compliment me on it at times this changed a while ago I have been involved in bodybuilding for the last year and decided to start taking creatine roughly three months ago before that I did not notice any effect of exercise on my skin except some small pimples on my chin area after a month of creatine usage I realized that my skin was getting worse with some breakouts all over my face forehead and temples and especially chin and low jawline area I first removed the protein supplement from my diet thinking it was the cause and only 2 weeks later realized upon the research that creatine was the real culprit I instantly stopped taking it and the only supplement I take now is natural dairy free protein powder along with the skin care regimen I follow this every day I am using a cleanser along with moisturizer twice a day and it has helped almost to clear my forehead and temples I assumed my breakouts were due to dehydration in the period I was taking creatine but only noticed slight progress in my chin area although the bumps on my skin now do not feel as tough and dry as they did and do not itch anymore unless I forget to moisturize I drink lots of water and have just bought a 97 pure aloe vera gel tube that I am going to apply twice a day I am afraid whether this condition could last a long time after quitting creatine I am really worried as it is seriously damaging my confidence and overall wellbeing is there anything I need to know or anything I can do on my own to help the healing process two weeks ago I decided to take a break from working out and thought that I noticed some improvement as in decreased redness but I do not feel too sure about it but I would really hate to quit work out\n\nDOCTOR: hi for further information consult a dermatologist online\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about

  "api_response": "DESCRIPTION: persistent dizziness after starting new blood pressure medication\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I was recently diagnosed with mild hypertension and my doctor prescribed me Lisinopril 10 mg daily about three weeks ago since starting the medication I have been experiencing constant dizziness that gets worse when I stand up quickly the dizziness is accompanied by lightheadedness and sometimes I feel like I might faint I have been checking my blood pressure at home and it ranges from 100/60 to 110/70 which seems lower than my usual readings before medication I have been trying to stay hydrated and move slowly when changing positions but the symptoms persist I am worried because I work as a delivery driver and this dizziness makes it unsafe for me to drive I cannot reach my primary doctor until next week should I stop taking the medication or reduce the dose on my own\n\nDOCTOR: hi welcome to icliniq com what you are experiencing sounds like orthostatic hypotension which is a known side effect of blood pressure medications like Lisinopril your current blood pressure readings are indeed on the lower side which explains your dizziness it is crucial that you do not adjust your medication dosage without consulting your doctor as suddenly stopping or changing blood pressure medication can cause dangerous fluctuations in your blood pressure I recommend you contact your doctor's office immediately to discuss these symptoms they may want to adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication in the meantime make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids avoid sudden position changes and consider temporarily avoiding driving until your symptoms are properly managed\n\nSTATUS: medium severity",
