I get chest stabbing even after my cough subsides why\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I had a cough since the start this month but it was just a dry cough it has got severe when the quarantine started and I could not schedule anymore consultation I had taken mucolytic which gave me severe coughing but it released a lot of phlegm yellow or greenish color I tried calling my friends who are nurses and I got a doctor whom I consulted and gave me prescription of co amoxiclav I had no fever chills and night sweats I have a chest stabbing pain for more than two weeks now today the pain level for me is 6 whenever I clear my throat or cough a little I have taken co amoxiclav 625 my three times a day for the past one week but the pain did not go away but my cough stopped and I had just very few episodes of coughing usually when I wake up my throat does not hurt or itch anymore but I am more bothered by the chest pain now the inner pain started before just below my breast on the right but now it is nearly on the chest itself but still on the right please advise\n\nDOCTOR: hello the most probable cause for the chest pain in the setting of the problems described by you is due to muscle spasm on account of indiscriminate coughing when the infection was present now the phlegm is less signifying decreased infection or healing what you need are some muscle relaxants and pain killers couple this with some balm application locally followed by steam and hot fomentation take adequate rest this shall pass nothing to worry if you need any further support or clarification do not hesitate to contact me\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same
