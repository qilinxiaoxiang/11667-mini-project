  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: my husband foreskin is stuck after he pulled it back while urinating what can be done for the pain\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor my husband is having pain in penis head the foreskin got backwards and now it not coming back to original form and not covering head of penis yesterday when my husband was urinating he tried pulling foreskin and it went backwards after that it not coming to front before also he was not able to pull it backwards so while having sex and wearing condom there was no problem once when we had unprotected sex his foreskin went backwards and he was in pain the foreskin was coming forward he is in pain what can be done is it normal or not we had sex a month ago with precaution\n\nDOCTOR: hello it looks like your husband is suffering from a condition called phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head or glans of the penis now this can happen due to a number of reasons and can be diagnosed only after examination this usually happens when one does not clean under the foreskin can lead to bacteria fungus or other germs accumulating there when this happens for some time it can lead to balanitis inflammation of the glans or the head of the penis has this happened before tight shiny skin on the glans redness around the glans itchiness or irritation of the glans an unpleasant smell tight foreskin that cannot be pulled back etc when this happens it can lead to phimosis after examination only I will be able to diagnose whether it is balanitis or phimosis and whether this is due to bacteria or fungus or some other cause the treatment varies depending on the findings therefore if the pain is severe it would be best to take him to a urologist and get it examined on the other hand if the penis is red and swollen you should take him to the emergency room if you want I can give you a cream for the pain but if there is infection there is a chance it will become worse I understand there is lockdown but if the pain is not too severe you can wait until lockdown is lifted let me know what you decide and any other queries you may have\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I took accutane for 10 months and stopped it three months back why is my skin bumpy now\n\nPATIENT: i was accutane for 10 months at 40 my for the majority I have been off of it for months and am noticing bumpy skin they are not pimples just small slightly elevated bumps\n\nDOCTOR: hello what are your symptoms exactly if they are of depression then the treatment with an sari selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is ideally given for six months or so basically if you are depressed you will feel irritable low feel like crying sad do not wish to eat have difficulty sleep there can be anxiety tiredness headaches etc in bipolar illness there will be a period of these depressive symptoms and then after a period of normalcy the reverse happens that is you feel unusually happy for no reason there are episodes of spending money excessively on things which you do not need or maybe excessive use of alcohol other illicit drugs sex irritable behavior decreased need for sleep and still feeling fresh grandiose talks and ideas many non goal directed activities etc so if you have not had the manic and hypomanic phase then you probably suffered from major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder so if you are just depressive then saris are to be used and if you are bipolar then a mood stabilizer will be added to the prescription\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: young patient is suffering from decreasing memory does it mean dementia\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am an 18 year old female who has for the past months been experiencing that my memory is degrading badly I have always had a memory that was fair enough I do have much stress and I do have social anxiety I do not sleep that well but that was never a problem before I sleep around 7 hours on school week and hours on a holiday I do take some medications for my add and I am aware there are some side effects to that medicine I could not even remember a friend name that I recently met for some split seconds then after some thinking I could finally remember it I can remember certain situations that were very important I could remember something from years ago but not weeks ago and I do feel like my memory gets better after I eat food but it feels like it is getting worse as time passes I did as a child had to do mind memory games at school but I felt like I could still remember basic information or situations that happened some days prior but now I cannot even remember what I did days ago is there something wrong with me I am showing early signs of dementia or I am just overreacting\n\nDOCTOR: hi I appreciate that you approached for counseling I am not sure whether you are diagnosed with add or not also please do mention medicines you are taking based on given information it seems that you are experiencing attention problems due to stressful events and preoccupations in your daily work also lack of quality sleep may effect concentration that leads to recalling problems you need thorough assessment for that apparently it is related to anxiousness and stress factors dementia occurs in later age of life and you are too young for that you might need help for anxiety management and stress management also if you are diagnosed with add then another detailed assessment is required\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about formatting]\nSTATUS: [low severity / medium severity / high severity]\n\nGenerate ONLY the new scenario, no meta-commentary.",
