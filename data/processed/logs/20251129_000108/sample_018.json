1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I am hypochondriac about tourette syndrome how likely will I get it\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am a female who is turning 20 years old in two months I was recently diagnosed with high functioning autism after suspecting for two years that I could have that condition I have never had any kind of ticks or repetitive and involuntary movements or sounds when I was 15 I started to become really hypochondriac since I have had anxiety since and tourette syndrome was my nightmare every year I would suspect without symptoms that I was starting to develop it recently I started to get spasm face and legs before falling asleep and those spasms are now in my eyebrows and eyelids as well including during the day my eyes feel like blinking normally once every 10 15 seconds without me controlling it is it possible that I am developing tourette\n\nDOCTOR: hello tics are quite common and experienced by many people tics happen more prominently when you are worried and stressed you have been reporting anxiety and particularly worried about tourette's syndrome tourette's syndrome is a severe form of tic disorder where a person has both motor and vocal tics present consistently for more than a year from your description you do not appear to have tourette's syndrome I can understand you are excessively worried about possible tics which is making your anxiety worse it will be helpful to try relaxation strategies to manage anxiety deep breathing techniques and jacobson progressive muscle relaxation exercises will help tics become less when you are less worried if anxiety is getting worse consult a doctor or psychologist for professional support I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: why do I have indigestion and vomiting since a month\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I am having indigestion and vomiting since one month it is not frequent but twice or thrice in a week when I am having my dinner after eating half of the meals I feel some air in my stomach and suddenly vomit everything I am having this issue in the morning too when I wake up I feel my stomach is full indigestion is also there please suggest me some medicine thank you\n\nDOCTOR: hello it is usually due to changes in the oh of the stomach and changed secretions including hydrochloric acid go for some tests and upload the reports other causes may be a gross pathology of the gastrointestinal tract most probably in the upper gi tract for that an endoscopic examination is mandatory to rule it out h pyloric helicobacter pyloric screening test esophagogastroduodenoscopy end you need to consult a gastroenterologist for thorough evaluation and management he will go for end ask your physician for prescription of dexilant dexlansoprazole twice before meals and itopride thrice a day before meals take citrucel methylcellulose dietary fiber supplement with plenty of water take bland diet and avoid spicy hot and sour meals fast and fried food revert back with the investigation reports to an internal medicine physician online\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: will antidepressant and opioid combination develop serotonin syndrome in elderly\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor my father is a 73 year old male with the following diagnoses essential tremor congestive heart failure he has a pacemaker hypertension borderline diabetes arthritis in the hips depression moderate to severe and cognitive issues he received an epidural yesterday for pain in his hips and buttocks and my mother found his medication list and shared it with me I am somewhat alarmed about the anti depressants and opioid combinations in particular after doing some research on serotonin syndrome kindly evaluate his prescription\n\nDOCTOR: hi looking at the age and co morbid conditions the polypharmacy multiple drugs is a must at the same time the clinician will assess monitor the patient for any serious side effects or drug incompatibility since your father has many geriatric complaints I feel all these drugs are required due to old age he may be having some trouble with kidney or liver functions most of the drug gets metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys hence continuous monitoring is required as per the clinician advice I hope you are following the clinician advice regarding depression and pain in the hip the antidepressant drugs and analgesic are unavoidable please do not worry about its side effects like serotonin syndrome this is not seen in all the patients the symptoms of serotonin syndrome will be taken care of by other antihypertensive or cardiac drugs sometimes he develops diarrhea as I told earlier do not worry about the side effects these are not seen in all patients and these drugs are mandatory for your father he can avoid tyearamine rich foods example beer chocolate alcoholic beverages fermented foods cheese sore cream yogurt shrimp paste soy sauce soybean condiments teriyaki sauce tempeh miso soup sauerkraut kimchi etc the antidepressant drugs cause side effects only if more tyearamine rich food is consumed while under the medication I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about
