  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: how to treat acute diarrhea and vomiting\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor my son is 21 months old he is suffering from very acute diarrhea that is four to five times in an hour and frequent vomiting four times a day from the last four days we consulted a local doctor he advised the attached prescription and stool test as per him it is due to severe bacterial infection in the stomach which is resulting in diarrhea my son is not suffering with dehydration and his fluid intake is sufficient he himself is asking for food but due to frequent motions he is weak and the rashes makes him irritated please give your suggestions we are worried as it seems that medicines are not healing it in a faster way he got only relief in three days doctor said that it will take three to four days to become normal and stool test is also fine\n\nDOCTOR: hello I understand your concern for your child I have seen the attached documents acute diarrhea give him or with each loose stool or whatever amount child takes prepare by adding a whole sachet in liter water syearup zinc my for 14 days consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent revert back with the answers to the above questions to a paediatrician online\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I get recurrent fungal infection in ear with pain and tinnitus why does it happen\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I want to ask about the condition of my ear because I have pain in one ear and I had some fungi in addition to the tinnitus I recently went to a doctor so he gave me some drops to eliminate these fungi but after getting rid of those few fungi I do not hear as well as the other ear some blood started flowing and the pain is more I think that there are infections and something more dangerous because the blood has not stopped please help\n\nDOCTOR: hi as you have rightly put it there is a possibility of recurrent fungal infection what we call as otomycosis this condition is very notorious for its recurrence even after treatment usually usage of earbuds I q tip initiate the entire problem as often the cotton tip is not sterilized in a proper manner thereby introducing infection the entire fungal blob can obstruct your ear canal and you will have fullness along with itching and associated pain it is very essential that the fungal blob be suctioned out completely not leaving backtrace of fungal hyphae as they can form another colony in no time I recommend you to see an ent to get this entire blob suctioned out continue to use the antifungal ear drops I usually recommended a combination containing clotrimazole as it is the most effective in treating such conditions it will take a while before your ear gets back to normal and there is nothing you need to get stressed about as it is a very common entity we encounter in the outpatient department I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what are the ways to prevent recurrence of mesa infection\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I am a 49 year old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after days I was treated with about iv antibiotics I do not remember them all I recall seeing vancomycin and penicillin I was told that the infection was not mesa but a slower moving bacteria they did not tell me what it was I was swabbed for mesa in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it for the last day of my stay I had a roommate who had a bad mesa infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes I had no physical contact with her but we had the same nurse I was discharged with a five day course of augmenting the wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm I went to an urgent care and was prescribed clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage the abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days I got it drained and was prescribed augmenting and told to also continue the clindamycin that was a week ago and the wound is healing well they called today and said cultures show it was mesa and they prescribed bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened could I have gotten it in the hospital I am concerned that it will not go away are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have mesa a month ago I have never had any medical problems before and these experiences have been very frightening is there anything else I can do to prevent recurrence I have read about everything from bleach baths and hibiclens to antibiotics in the nose\n\nDOCTOR: hi I am sorry for what you have had to go through as you previously did not have mesa strains it is possible that now you have hospital acquired strains in your blood it is a superbug and superdifficult to treat as it is resistant to drugs of choice so you have get culture and sensitivity test to find out which one is it sensitive to as you were told to stop other antibiotics and start bactrim this means the strain you have got is sensitive to bactrim if there is anything else you want to ask please feel free to contact me\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about formatting]\nSTATUS: [low severity
