1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: is it possible to have a safe pregnancy with a fibroid uterus\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am married for ten months I had a miscarriage of 10 weeks baby now again I expect five weeks of pregnancy at my first miscarriage checkup the doctor said that I have a fibroid of 2 am within the uterus at the intermural side also at that time my torch test was positive and were positive and I took medicines will I have a safe pregnancy this time what can I do please suggest\n\nDOCTOR: hello there are two things one is to have a pregnancy and the second is the growth of the pregnancy both are different and require different approaches in the treatment point of view as you said there were and positive if it was egg immunoglobulin positive then you need not worry it suggests the past infection but as you have taken tablets and completed the course no need to worry you said that you have a fibroid around 2 am intramural it is true that fibroid can increase the chance of abortion but it is also true many pregnancies with fibroid goes up to the term without any complications and have delivered the baby normally so continue the treatment prescribed by your doctor take maximum rest avoid heavy weight lifting intercourse jerky work and work while bending and hopefully you will have a normal pregnancy\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what are the ways to manage gas formation in stomach\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor yesterday in the evening I felt strong heaviness in my stomach and gas started forming stomach seems to be full without eating anything light pain also started today morning also no clear stool no choice to take food hence only some fruits taken in breakfast presently also stomach feeling full of gas light pain feeling in the morning I have taken one tablet of gas in empty stomach rabiprazole with domperidone what to take for relief since office hours has started and I want to be fit\n\nDOCTOR: hello I can understand you had a terrible time due to this problem since yesterday the gas production in bowel is a normal phenomenon and majorly produces on its own given the number of gas forming bacteria within human gut however there are certain foods and environmental triggers that can increase the gas production foods containing cereals grains such as wheat corn maze barley oats millets and milk cauliflower and many others that even you can find out yourself so your symptoms and just an overnight onset with worsening intensity suggest you probably have one of these gas producing food a day before yesterday if you can find out the foods that make you feel gas then it would be very easy to omit that diet from your diet and go well it is fine to continue with the rabiprazole for now but I want to substitute another medication over domperidone tablet digestive 40 my once daily before meals you can increase the dose to twice daily before meals if you dont feel improvement in next 48 hours gas and bloating I can consider testing you thoroughly if your symptoms remain for a week or so and does not improve with the medications I prescribed silo follow up in days to update me how you doing\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: why does my blood sugar level go up even without doing anything\n\nPATIENT: hello I have been a diabetic for about 20 years my recent arc is 4 from last few days I have been noticing that my fasting sugar readings are really high like 140 180 there have been no changes in the diet interestingly enough within 2 hours it goes up by another 20 points without doing anything another strange thing is before I go to bed it is in the range of 10 130 but in the morning it is always 140 please help me understand this strange phenomen I am taking 100mcg metformin twice a day\n\nDOCTOR: hi thanks for your query its good to see ur sugars are good with hba1c 4 blood sugars go up and down not only with meals but there are many other factors associated as well like other harmon levels in the body for example if ur stressed mentally or excited ur cortisol and catecholamines also increase and thus may lead to increase sugar levels as well same way if you will do exercise it will decrease ur sugar as well as use of alcohol may be ur eating habits did not change much but other factors have something to do with these levels sleep is also important along with medications I always advise for intermittent fasting and low carbohydrates with least grains exercise even if it is just walking 45 minutes daily is beneficial thanks\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format
