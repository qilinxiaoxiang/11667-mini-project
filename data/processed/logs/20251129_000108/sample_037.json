1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: why am I having swelling and pain in penis after scrotoplasty\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor two weeks ago I had a scrotoplasty accompanied with this was liposuction around lower stomach and inside of thighs towards the groin to thicken the penis operation went well had general swelling and edema of the penis and scrotum with pain I have been taking anti inlfammatory tables antibacterial antibiotics and pain killers one of the symptoms I have had is pain in my penis when I stand it is like the blood rushes to that area and cause discomfort I then lie back down and the pain subsides based on this I have just been resting I noticed yesterday when feeling the scrotum that my left testicle has swollen I am guessing it is about two inches long by 5 inches wide in the shape of an egg it is not soar to touch but feels hard the scrotum or stiches do not show any signs or redness and the scrotum appears to be okay in color I have not had a fever or vomiting I have read different reports on line as to why this could be like fluids draining from liposuction into scrotum severe edema orchitis etc and advice would be appreciated\n\nDOCTOR: hi first of all I would like to inform you that size mentioned by you is within normal range and it should not be called swelling unless there is gross difference from other side the average tests size is to am in length and to am in width now regarding feeling hard this is completely normal after scrotoplasty as there is mild deem of testicular skin along with tests itself this may take almost 6 weeks to completely disappear I feel this is normal complication of surgery as there is no fever no tenderness no redness sighs of inflammation I would like to inform you that keeping scrotal support and proper rest may help you in case this continues to remain in same stage sort aggravates with time it will be ideal to see your doctor and get examined regarding other symptoms related to pain at the tip of penis I feel this is due to clogging of secretions in urethra which creates problem in my opinion excess intake of water and fluids may help you\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: my brother behaves harshly to all with murder thoughts how to help him\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor how do I help my 16 year old teen brother who refuses to get help I believe he needs help but the last time we went to the doctor they sent him to a counselor who did not do much when talking to a counselor and other people he does not show his true colors at home he has a very bad temper and tries to fight with everyone the only one he gets along with is one of his brothers he has threatened to kill himself because he does not have his laptop anymore it broke and he has also stated along the lines that he wants to kill our parents because it is their fault he is like this to be fair our parents are very religious I do not know how to help him because he does not want help he says no one cares about him and we all want his life to be bad what do I do to help\n\nDOCTOR: hello it can be difficult to see your family going through challenging circumstances from your report it looks like your teenaged brother is struggling to regulate his behavior blames others and is not able to take responsibility for his actions as you may know already there is no quick fix solution try to be supportive and available whenever your brother needs you he is lucky to have an understanding sister like you he needs to gently changed when he says no one cares about him why does he think so is he misinterpreting things you said he gets on well with one of his brothers use it positively and involve this brother in getting help for your troubled sibling encourage him to enroll in some course apprenticeship which will give some positive experience for him encourage him to join some sports clubs discuss with your parents about adopting a supportive firm boundaries relationship with your brother and avoid criticism and confrontational interactions it may help to have a mentor to talk to him regularly and guide him to make the right choices it can be any responsible adult whom your brother trusts and will talk to finally encourage him to see a counselor or doctor again if problems persist\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample

bumps all over my body which are getting darker after going away I have attached the photos please help\n\nDOCTOR: hello I have examined the pictures attachments removed to protect patient identity and noted your details the description matches closely that of superficial folliculitis which is a low grade bacterial infection of the hair follicles and is recurrent in nature for someone attending with me in my clinic and having a similar profile I would have taken full history and conducted local and general physical examination and would have suggested the following measures it is expected that with above measures there should be improvement within a week or so it would be good to keep me updated so that I can guide you through the recovery process for further information consult a dermatologist online\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the
