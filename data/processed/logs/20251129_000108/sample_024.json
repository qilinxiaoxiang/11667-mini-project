  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have burn like mark which keeps increasing in size what is it\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I have a small formation in my leg which developed approximately before three years I have attached the images for your reference it is brown in color somewhat similar to a burn it itches sometimes and it is very dry in nature this formation was initially around am but now has increased in size to am which is the reason of my concern whenever it itches I only use antiseptic lotions suthol besides I have parkinson disease and I take sleeping pill every night please advice\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have seen your pictures and well understand your concern you are having lichen simplex chronicus lac it arises because of repetitive scratching or rubbing I could see thickening of the skin with variable flakes lichen simplex chronicus usually described as stable itchy and thickened one or more areas however thickening of the skin occurs on any location that the patient can reach like nape of neck extensor forearms and elbows scrotum upper medial thighs knees lower legs and ankles in your case it involves extensor aspects of ankles cause for lac includes age related dryness venous insufficiency like tortuous veins or pooling of bloods due to prolong standing or weakness of blood vessels wall due to aging and eczema in old age due to bath with hot water asteatotic eczema are common factors age related dryness venous insufficiency like tortuous veins pooling of bloods due to prolong standing weakness of blood vessels wall due to aging eczema in old age due to bath with hot water asteatotic eczema skin biopsy for histopathological examinations and serum immunoglobulin 1 lichen simplex chronicus neurodermatitis lichen simplex chronicus apply xerina cream glycolic acid or moisture cream combination of urea liquid paraffin propylene glycol and lactic acid wait for 15 minutes and then apply topical steroids with salicylic acid should be applied twice daily for two to four weeks and also take one tablet levocetirizine once daily for similar duration propysalic of lotion clobetasol and salicylic acid combination occlusive dressing will be more helpful the method of occlusion is after application of propysalic lotion put flat polythene cover then cotton bandage and leave it for whole night for two to three days occlusion is not need in day time you can also try injection kenacort triamcinolone acetonide 10 my 1 my am intralesional at the three weeks interval should be given by dermatologist try to avoid scratching whenever you feel itch apply moisturizer or dip wet cotton in normal tap water and put over it revert back after a month to a dermatologist online\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have severe tonic clonic seizures and get sudden cardiac arrest is it anoxic brain injury\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor does the length of time in critical care always reflect the severity is the length of time on a ventilator depend more on the cause I longer if lung infection rather than neurological etc can you have severe illness complications and still be in icu for a short while when I was 21 I had severe uncontrolled tonic clonic seizures constant on and off for a day then last over an hour and a half apparently I had every medication could have if the last drug did not work then there was nothing else I could have apparently I then had a cardiac arrest where the doctor had said it was very difficult to get me back tried for a long time my heart was struggling and was not breathing I was anesthetized and on a ventilator I had blood gases showing acidosis high lactate also egg showed it changes and right axis deviation echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy and right ventricular dilatation this was not there just weeks before no urine output apparent renal insufficiency blood glucose in the 30 amol eg showed non reactive background alpha cat scan showed low attenuation temporal lobe mri showed matter changes my family were told to come in immediately in the middle of the night as doctors felt I might not make it and if I had another seizure would not be able to stop it I had a do not resuscitate order put on why did they put do not resuscitate order on me at 21 I hear of people who were in critical care for much longer I have memory flashbacks and cannot figure out why the length of stay does not relate to severity I was on a ventilator for 12 hours and sedation coma reduced over two days I was in for three to four days I feel it was rushed and if it had not been then I may have not got the lasting problems I have now the word anoxic brain injury has been mentioned after in icu I have had many problems seizures ataxia very brisk hyper reflex is reflexes more in legs than arms babinski reflex tremor myoclonus altered sensation numbness of arms down to feet especially back of hands I have memory problems and a different personality I find it hard to learn new things etc are these common symptoms of anoxic brain injury\n\nDOCTOR: hi I am so sorry that you went through so much and I am glad to know that you have made it you are extremely lucky to have survived all this it seems like after persistent seizure you developed acidosis that pushed you in cardiogenic shock very few people come out of it you are the second case in my 12 years of experience that I have seen communicating ventilators has its own complications and they can lead to mortality and morbidity which are more difficult to battle than the real problem therefore it is always recommended to wean as soon as possible anoxic brain injury occurs right there an then when the event occurs ventilators could only prevent part of it and not the entire process I was curious to know what brought it on in the first place why did you had the seizures like did you had the seizure disorder or an infection process anoxic brain injury can have various consequences and yes it can cause different psychological motor and cognitive deficits depending upon which part of the brain was involved I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: will cutting down of xanax dose lead to additional psychological disturbance\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I have been taking my of xanax a day to treat severe panic attack syndrome and associated high levels of general anxiety for 15 years my doctor arrived at the my per day amount gradually and it works very well along with cut from a therapist before two months when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for my day I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it when I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my gad symptoms increased to the point where cut methods were not working then last month the script was back to my per day normal dosage I thought yes back to normal but again this month the script was back down to my per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose I again asked for an explanation and was not given any my question is a 25 cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me\n\nDOCTOR: hello there are a few clarification and advice that I need to make reducing the dosage of alprazolam results in alprazolam withdrawal a reduction by 25 is unlikely to be physically dangerous but the withdrawal symptoms are going to be highly unpleasant the anxiety of withdrawal is quite similar to your panic and generalized anxiety and it is difficult to make a difference between the two withdrawal anxiety will reduce over time I do not think that your disease will worsen because of this to the initial level but the withdrawal will cause distress for a few weeks I recommend using more nonpharmacological therapies like relaxation training during this period ask your doctor to avoid making sharp changes in dose and consider adding drugs like saris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors etc breaking your tablets and taking the pieces in such a way so that you reduce the inter dose interval without changing the dose I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the
