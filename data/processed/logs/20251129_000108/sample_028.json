specification association with proteins shake your report also shows chronic gastritis which also adds to your discomfort this issue usually improves with medications but recurs after some time my recommendations will be some changes in your medications for some time and then will readjust and down titrate again meanwhile you need some precautions as well hiatus hernia leading to herd

can scattered white matter lesion of unsure etiology be suspected for ms\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor the radiologist stated scattered white matter lesions but does not tell the location or size they state as unsure etiology or clinical significance the ordering physician suspects is due to symptoms like disorientation incontinence and body pain if the radiologist suspected is would not they state the size and location and diagnoses suspected disease or kind of lesion was this a poor report or was he basically not sure of what is going on I leave it up to the ordering doctor I have done blood for lupus arthritis lyme disease and complete blood test\n\nDOCTOR: hi the few scattered white matter lesions could mean that there are areas in the white matter of brain which are seen as small pinhead size on to and flair sequence this is commonly from small vessel ischemic changes and is seen usually in older age and slightly uncommon in the young population the cause is sometimes unknown suspicion of is multiple sclerosis is by diagnostic criteria and matching it with clinical examination there is mcdonald's criteria for imaging in is and if the radiologist did not mention any findings which are under these criteria then it is unlikely to be is from this scan the criteria specify that the patient might require a subsequent mri scan and the new scan is compared with the old one to make a probable diagnosis of is in you it is clear that the findings are less likely to be from is on this scan talking about radiologist every person has their comfortable style of reporting and I feel mentioning the location of the larger white matter lesions would have been good for your ordering doctor I will not say this is a poor report but surely it can be improved by providing the size and location of the larger white matter lesions I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: my dad has adenocarcinoma of prostate with no bone metastasis how to treat him\n\nPATIENT: hello

side effects my dad is 78 years old and he has high blood pressure he did bone metastasis and it came back negative what is the best treatment for my dad\n\nDOCTOR: hi it looks your father has been diagnosed with prostate cancer the good thing is that his bone scan is free of metastasis spread I will suggest them to do an mri magnetic resonance imaging pelvis and ray chest plus abdominal ultrasound for staging these investigations will show the extension of the prostatic tumor if the tumor is confined to the prostate only he needs a surgical assessment for the possible radical removal of the prostate along with the tumor if they found him unfit for surgery or inoperable tumor then the next step is radiotherapy and hormonal therapy in general prostatic cancer is usually a slow growing tumor it takes years to spread to other parts from stage to stage prostate cancer five years of survival is almost 100\n\nSTATUS: high
