severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I get anxiety attack with sudden chemical depletion how to overcome it\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor more than 20 years ago I suffered from anxiety derived from the use of drugs and my family situation from which I recovered with deanxit and psychoanalytic therapy of course I quieted cocaine forever I was in therapy for seven years at the end I recovered completely having a full and happy life for more than 10 years I have a great wife and daughter and very good friends and have a good relation with my family the fact is that I was feeling very well until about two years ago I began to experiment as if I could not enjoy things a few months later being quiet at home at night an incredible and strong chemical depletion suddenly came over me it was like a feeling of chemical depletion of the neurotransmitters or something like that in the brain that caused me a downturn similar to when you use drugs like when you have a sudden drop of blood pressure it was not the depression of being crying feeling of worthlessness deep sadness it was these desperate and unbearable feeling this lasted about days so I went to my psychiatrist because I could not take that feeling of intense downturn anymore I have to say that years ago I had already felt those feelings for short periods of time like a few minutes and then disappeared but I did not give them much more importance he prescribed me deanxit again two times a day and after four days I was fine the fact is that he withdrew it a month and the next day I noticed again the unbearable symptoms of the beginning I went back to the medication and felt good again but I wanted to switch to a stronger one following my psychiatrist advice because sometimes I was still feeling bad I tried many others that did not work or made me feel worse I have tried in between other therapies such as cognitive behavioral emdr acupuncture and I believe that none comes to the heart of the matter that it is a serious chemical imbalance that is happening to me and that I cannot overcome and balance I have also performed neurofeedback as well as resonance of the head requested by a neurologist and they saw nothing I am a person who is not obsessed at all with things very cautious in life and have a successful business for years I do not usually stress except on some occasions and I consider myself quite rational in general so I cannot understand why this is happening to me I am looking for someone who can diagnose my disease beyond the generic term of depression and anxiety in which because of the symptoms that I have explained I am not reflected I think that the dysphoria would be the closest but I also do not feel that irritability that accompanies it have you met a patient with similar symptoms before or maybe someone to whom you can refer me to understand what is happening here I absolutely trust science and I just want to return to the state of normality that I had before all these crises that I repeat are so intense and unbearable that I want to die when I suffer them and that I need to understand what happens to me having more opinions from other experts\n\nDOCTOR: hello welcome to icliniq com you have actually got everything right with what you think you are experiencing it is dysthymia basically the neurotransmitter deficiency be it for whatever reason is the cause in males it usually appears between 30 to 40s also it is not necessary to have irritability to be called dysthymic basically if you look at a figure of 50 between to 100 as normal and the baseline for mood you are persistently unable to return to the baseline and are always beneath the normal mood what people call as mildly depressed this dysthymic period when an episode of depression is superimposed is called double depression which is the episodic problems that sometimes occur the core of treatment here is the addition of a mood stabilizer such as lithium that in addition to an antidepressant will show you the greatest improvement basically the antidepressant will elevate your mood and the mood stabilizer will hold it there rest in addition to the medicines you should continue your therapies as advised I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the
