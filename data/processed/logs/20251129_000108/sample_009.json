Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I do not have oily foods but still have pimples why\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I am 21 years old I am suffering from pimples and their dark spots what happens is one or two pimples appear and vanish in two to four days leaving dark spots behind the same thing repeats again and again now there is a lot of dark spots in my face I do not use oil in my hair and also avoid oily foods pimples contain something whitish what should I do please suggest\n\nDOCTOR: hello I can understand your concern you need to take proper medicine for the treatment of pimples so that dark spots will not appear seborrhea or hormonal imbalance acne vulgaris with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation revert back after six weeks to a dermatologist online\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: pelvic ultrasound suggest endometriosis and adenomyosis will they cause infertility in long run\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am a 32 year old female I had my second baby via section a couple of months after I started getting pelvic pain the pain is across my whole pelvic area and lower back and some times in my thighs too very similar to menstrual cramps occasionally I would get a sharp pain on either side of my pelvic area especially on the right side I also get pelvic cramps every time after sexual intercourse and occasional pain when I go to the toilet the pain is bearable and when it gets a little worse I can manage it by taking pain killers I get the pain almost every single day as well not just when I am on my period my periods have always been very heavy and painful from the beginning but have been able to keep it under control by taking the combined contraceptive pill gedarel 30 150 my and mefenamic acid which I have been taking for many years I have also been getting headaches and I am always very tired due to the lack of sleep I get from these pains during the night half the time I feel very stressed out because of the way I am feeling and it is not easy being a mom of two young children as well and having to manage with the pains etc I eventually visited the go and had some tests done such as smear tests infection swabs blood tests and an ultrasound scan everything was normal but the transvaginal ultrasound showed I have endometriosis and adenomyosis I was referred to a specialist gynecologist and although he has given me a course of action to follow for the next six months I felt that the appointment was a bit rushed and I had a lot of questions to ask regarding the two conditions I would really like to ask a few questions regarding the conditions as soon as possible because my next appointment is not for another six months and there are a few things I would like to know about how these two conditions will affect me in the long run I just need some answers for peace of mind nothing specific to me but more about the disease itself the doctor has advised to take the combined contraceptive pill for another six months without a break and to take pain killers as and when required the consultant also mentioned progesterone based methods but we had to rule that out as it causes hair loss and I have been through years of a form of alopecia and have just managed to get my hair back I have tried asking doctors online and have been conned by them because they have taken money from me and just copied and pasted answers from other places online which made me quite upset and furious hopefully someone from here can give me proper and professional answers these are the following questions I would like to ask what causes these two conditions I am aware that these two conditions cannot be 100 diagnosed via imaging methods and laparoscopy is the only method that provides a definitive diagnosis so how can a clinician be sure that they are treating me for the right condition and it is not something worse how will these conditions affect me in the long run if they begin the progress which out of the two endometriosis or adenomyosis is more severe and serious how will they affect my fertility and what would happen if I wanted to have another baby in the future will it be hard to get pregnant will it cause problems to either me or the baby is there an increased risk of miscarriages and preterm labor and if so how likely is this what if I were to come off the pill for whatever reason how can I manage these conditions are there any other methods or a form of lifestyle I can follow to help such as certain dietary intakes etc how can I prevent getting pain when I go to the toilet mainly passing stool and help with sleep any other information will be greatly appreciated also are there any online groups or support websites for these conditions\n\nDOCTOR: hello welcome to iclniq com I have read your query both problems more or less will have the same effect in the long run it might affect you getting pregnant but if you get pregnant then symptoms of endometriosis subsided may be for ever it does not have any effects on pregnancy and baby no risk of preterm delivery or anything the permanent solution for this condition is the removal of uterus and ovary but not recommended if you have plans for further pregnancy of oral contraceptive pills can help you in disease suppression some gnrh gonadotropin releasing hormone injection are also available but they have side effects so not recommend for long term of pills can be taken for years if you miss of pills for two to three months or so then endometriosis should not return back immediately so any time if you want to stop it for a few months definitely you can do that talking about the sharp pelvic pain it could be because of fibrosis after cesarean section you can do some moderate exercise on a daily basis which can help you there are no specific dietary things which can help\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what can be the reason for sudden transient loss of vision\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor early this morning I lost vision in one of my eyes for about two minutes my vision then came back gradually over a period of couple of minutes I could not see any light at all it was not painful and I have not experienced this before I experienced an allergic reaction to a progesterone cream when I applied to my face the same day it burned my face and turned it red symptoms subsided after washing it off I am traveling and cannot get in to see a doctor until I return home in two weeks is it fine if I wait to see a doctor please help\n\nDOCTOR: hello for further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format
