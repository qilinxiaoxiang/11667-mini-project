  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: after chiropractic treatment for hiatal hernia I experience abdominal discomfort why\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor two months ago I was diagnosed with a very tiny hiatal hernia my chiropractor found my stomach is pushed up very high next to my esophagus he was able to push it back down but with a lot of painful force and manipulation ever since I have been getting sicker and sicker with episodes that are so debilitating that I can no longer work they happened occasionally at first but now three to four times each day always upon weakening and last for hours at a time it begins in my mid abdomen I feel and see pulsating in my abdomen and get a wet sensation as though the fluid is leaking out of my chest or belly if I push on that area or usually all by itself I get an instant rush of blood to my head and start to feel fuzzy my face turns bright red and becomes so hot that I get nauseous the redness sometimes stays sometimes goes away but what always follows immediately is intense heat throughout my whole body like my spine muscles and nerves are on fire everywhere from my head to my palms to my mouth to the soles of my feet then I start to shake uncontrollably with the shakes progressing into worse tremors in my left thigh and right biceps the shaking definitely seems to start from the abdomen or groin area if I press my thighs or groin or even touch them lightly my legs increase in spasticity when these episodes end I feel completely wiped out blurry vision and hard tired muscles but I never return to normal I always feel shaky and not myself I have been at the doctor twice when these episodes were happening the first time my be was a bit high at 130 mhg usually I am spot on at 120 80 mhg and the other time my vitals did not change at all during the episode other information possibly related my left thigh and knee are filled with fluid but my orthopedist attributes that to a popliteal cyst is that the same as an aneurysm he found behind my knee he gave me a cortisone injection four days ago but so far the swelling in the front of my thigh my knee and my calf have not gone down I was also told that I have an umbilical hernia and two inguinal hernias I also have a history of localized scleroderma which I understand can weaken the connective tissues and blood vessels recent blood tests for ana and rheumatoid factor both came back negative not sure how that is possible when I was diagnosed with a positive ana and localized scleroderma morphea 25 years ago I am very scared do you have any idea of what is happening to me or what tests I should have done not sure if this is gi related vascular rheumatology etc but I need to find a way to calm these spells so I can go back to work\n\nDOCTOR: hello welcome to icliniq com well the symptoms do sound a bit different and something we need to look into as per the issues I hope they have looked into any form of venous obstruction I super vein obstruction any compression on that vein can cause the face to turn red and a bit of low blood pressure but it is a very rare thing to happen a it computed tomography of the chest would be advisable to rule out this compression causing the symptoms but yes it does not explain what is happening in your legs the symptoms do see to be of hypersensitivity do these symptoms happen after a hot water bath as well do you feel any shock like sensation from the neck below for the popliteal cyst it is a bakers cyst it is totally different from aneurysm as aneurysm will be pulsating and moreover it is a very unusual site for it to happen normally it does respond to injection cortisone but sometimes if the injection does not go in the right place it can persist you may need to repeat the injection after a month or so incase it is persisting as for localized scleroderma it is a benign form and ana can go negative at times we can either call it a lab error or at times the body does act through to make it negative how much has been the skin extent in your scleroderma though to summarize we need to figure out a cause for your symptoms scleroderma does not explain it we need to see if it is an sec superior vena cava obstruction of the rarest cause with the spasticity happening in your legs on touching I would like to rule out any brain condition as well these sound like paroxysmal dyskinesia I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what can the open sore on head be\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor my husband has an open sore on his head it is the size of a softball with redness under it and it is causing a shocking pain into his ear it is swollen and has caused soreness in his neck and swollen adenoids it looks like it has mucus or pus which is trying to come out but nothing does he has been squeezing it like a pimple and soaking it with hot water and epsom salt previously he got bit by a spider twice and the wound had to be cut open and drained but it has never got like this before I can send pictures for your reference\n\nDOCTOR: hello infected sebaceous cyst developing an abscess excision of the cyst and antibiotic treatment preferably reflex cefalexin bactrim comprises of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim or doxycycline for further information consult a internal medicine physician online\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have hard crusty stuff around the ear canal with clear discharge what could it be\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I have this hard crusty stuff around the perimeter of my ear canal it itches and if I scratch it will come off but it sometimes causes clear fluid to drain out of my ear it also dissolves if I get water in my ear I am currently on amoxicillin for a tooth infection\n\nDOCTOR: hi probably you have a subclinical otitis externa in this condition there will be a very subtle infection in the ear canal which leads to an intense amount of itching with the use of earbuds the raw area gets exposed and flares up the irritation even more impacted wax can also be a source of the irritation in the ear this is often associated with fullness and pain you can follow the advice mentioned below please stop using earbuds henceforth tablet levocetirizine 10 my one tablet at night for the next 10 days wax dissolvent ear drops three times a day for the next five days keep the ear dry please wear a shower cap while bathing the scab will dry and fall off on its own so there is no need to keep touching it you can continue amor antibiotic as it has nothing to do with the current problem if there is anything more you want to know please do inform me\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice -
