1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: will irregular paleo diet result in low vitamin and b12 levels\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor this is for my husband on saturday he had a master health check up and a few values are not good I would like to hear your opinion on those he is 35 years old his weight is 71 keg and height is 168 am the abnormal values are as follows serum globulin 2 go do high normal range 3 2 to 46 ug my high normal 6 10 whereas to and ash are normal vitamin 65 low serum hel 34 low other triglycerides and lil values are normal vitamin b12 144 low normal 180 914 also I attached his egg where it was mentioned unconfirmed report please check and let me know the outcome of the report he is an athlete who is active in a cycling race running and swimming but he was out of the sport for one year and hence gained weight around 75 keg from 68 keg now again he reduced keg in the last three months but he is following bad diet plans such as paleo one week intermittent for the next week proper balanced normal food for one week hence I am really worried about his health\n\nDOCTOR: hi I feel his low vitamin b12 levels may be linked to his paleo diet which can be deficient in legumes nuts which are beneficial for the heart he need not be so fastidious about the diet I feel and vitamin b12 can be got from dairy products eggs fish and chicken his low vitamin levels are almost very prevalent in indians and basically this can be rectified by more outdoor activity and if need 60 units of rise once per week for six weeks his hel levels are low and although his lil bad cholesterol levels are also low I would recommend daily exercise half an hour daily to boost hel levels his isolated high to levels mean you need to check for a thyearoid goiter and possibly do a thyearoid scan but it could also be linked to high globulin levels isolated high globulins need work up too possibly disorders of immunity or rare disease like multiple myeloma possibly consult a hematologist I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: nose shape is deformed after septoplasty with turbinoplasty what to do\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I had septoplasty and turbinoplasty 16 days ago after the surgery they asked me to come back after two days for packs removal then after two days I went to the hospital other doctor look after me and he just removed one pack even I asked him to remove the packs on both sides but he refused it I then came back home after two days I cannot able to eat or even drink anything as my mouth smells very foul and the whole nose got swelled then after seven days I revisit a doctor then the doctor who did the surgery on me looked inside my nose and pulled out the pack hardly then after this my nose shape changed badly and I cannot breathe normally now what I can do now\n\nDOCTOR: hello I understand you underwent septoplasty and turbinoplasty and you have not completely recovered after septoplasty post operatively it takes about two to three months for complete healing and recovery you must put solspre nasal spray two puffs four times daily for about a month in either nostril if there is excessive dryness you must also instill 5 menthol paraffin nasal drops three drops in each nostril thrice daily the room where you stay must be adequately humidified and should have moisture you must drink plenty of water and take healthy foods you must go for weekly reviews with the ent surgeon who can look into the nose and see if the healing is good if not you may require suction clearance of the nasal cavities any clots or crusts may be causing the nasal blockage for you if after two months also you are not feeling any improvement kindly contact us we can reassess the problem and get you the best treatment\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample
