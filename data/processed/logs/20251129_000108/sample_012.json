1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I get itchy dry eyes after prolonged screentime with occasional vision loss why\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor my eyes hurt for about a week now I feel like resting for a long period of time they are itchy and dry there is a foreign object sensation sometimes I feel like I am losing my vision or it is getting weaker sometimes I do the 20 rule lately I have been spending a lot of time in front of the screen what could be the reason my eyes hurt currently I am taking isotretinoin 20 my twice a day and topical benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoid and clindamycin for chronic acne\n\nDOCTOR: hello you must get your be and blood sugar levels done monitor if normal or abnormal and consult a physician also get ad echo done as soon as possible and seek a cardiologist opinion the condition that you lost vision suddenly for some time is known as amaurosis fugax I am telling you this first because this is serious also it is a must to get your refraction done and also consult a retina specialist and get the detailed retinal examination done as well coming to your eye symptoms it would have been better if you share a picture of eyes but it seems like you have allergic symptoms I hope there is no discharge or stickiness of eyes you can use bepotastine 5 eye drop ads one drop in both eyes for two weeks soft drops 5 sodium carboxymethylcellulose eye drop six times a day one drop in both eyes for one month avoid any rubbing of eyes use goggles\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: I have a small penis of inches will it affect my sexual life\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor I am 25 years old I have a small penis size about 5 inches after erection and night falls five to seven times in a month my height is 168 am and weighs about 59 keg I am unmarried doing shift duty I sleep usually six to eight hours a day I have not taken any medical treatment for this problem\n\nDOCTOR: hello I read your query and understand your concerns from the mentioned parameters there is nothing normal other than night fall which is five to seven times per month regarding night falls I like to inform you that this is a natural process our body keeps on producing sperms irrespective of our sexual activity if the sperm get the way of outside by either sexual intercourse or masturbation then the problem is less likely to occur if somebody is not sexually active and not doing masturbation to release these sperm they get discharged automatically this is a kind of overflow this is more likely to occur when we have a lot of sexual fantasies and get dreams of sex or some other activity with beautiful girls the current night fall is may be all these things either you are not sexually active or not doing masturbation or getting dreams of sex or a combination of all these in regard to medical perspective there is nothing abnormal with this but in my view you need to get an appropriate partner for you it happens to almost everybody when they are not sexually active for a couple of days or weeks regarding your small size penis I would like to inform you that the average size of penis across the globe is three to five inches while erect presence of 5 inch size of penis is also absolutely normal and there is nothing to worry about this do not go for porn movies and old stories where a large penis is depicted as manhood capability even in the literature the girth of the penis is given more importance than length I will explain why the size does not matter the normal size of female vagina is about six to seven inches and out of this only outer one third is sensitive so I mean to say that a man who is able to stimulate outer one third of vagina is equal in sexual pleasure to the one who is able to stimulate full length to stimulate one third of female vagina a man need just three inch penis and nothing more fortunately you have much bigger than the minimum size of penis and you can satisfy any women who have normal size vagina other than this the sexual pleasure depends on the other factors like your age lust attraction to the partner your stress level to name a few the most important factor in sexual satisfaction is foreplay which takes place before true intercourse if you can devote sufficient time to it you are a man in true sense I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: why am I getting pus from the stitches of cesarean operation\n\nPATIENT: hi doctor I had a cesarean operation before nine months but my stitches have not been cured yet earlier pus used to come out of the hard structure and began to gather on my belly now after two months again a little bit of stitch has been opened please help me\n\nDOCTOR: hi I had gone through all the details you have posted for further information consult an internal medicine physician online\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice -
