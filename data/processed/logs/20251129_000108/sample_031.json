why my ortho does not put brackets in power chains while missing one or two spots I have straight teeth and I am in the sixth year with braces I think instead of closing gaps this is creating gaps please help\n\nDOCTOR: hello there are different types of power chains that are available for the treatment depending on the interlink space short connects every alternate bracket long connects every third bracket closed connects each bracket so depending on the stage of your treatment either of the types can be used which may or may not connect individual brackets also we would require the history of the type of malocclusion you had in the first place as the duration of the treatment varies with the complexity of the malocclusion complex malocclusion which require a lot of rotations and closure of gaps may take longer than usual also the density of your alveolar bone and your body bone remodeling rate affects the duration of final results so in order to give a definitive diagnosis we would require your treatment history which includes preoperative and post operative clinic photographs intraoral and extraoral both preoperative dental rays op and lateral cephalogram treatment history including the types of malocclusion brackets used wires used and the movements caused oral hygiene maintenance routine that you follow during the braces treatment waiting for your reply brush

years but now it is causing bad odor\n\nDOCTOR: hi implant supported bridge is an extremely good option for replacement of missing teeth implant is the best treatment option in dentistry and it is a lifelong treatment option it stays for ur whole life without causing any problem once osseointegration has taken place successfully it acts extremely perfect but you have to maintain your oral hygiene nicely you have to use electric brushes for maintaining your implant and you have to visit the dentist every year for follow up for scaling and polishing just for maintaining your oral hygiene go for it is the best treatment option if you are healthy systemically patients suffering from high blood pressure or diabetes might have some problems so your dentist will decide what is best in those

button since she was little unconnected to what she eats time of the day or stool pee she is used to ignore it she has a light form of vulvitis meaning it gets red and starts scratching so in order to fix this we use a dermatologic creme recommended by a dermatologist cicalfate before bed each day we wash her and use the creme and the skin returns to a normal aspect if we keep using the creme we tried other crimes as well mostly they work but if we stop the treatment it starts inflammation again there is no kind of liquid or secretion from vagina\n\nDOCTOR: hi the child has only day time
