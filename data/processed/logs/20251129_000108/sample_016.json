  "prompt": "You are a medical consultation expert.\nYour task is to create NEW medical consultation Q&A pairs that follow the same format and style as the examples below.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Generate COMPLETELY NEW scenarios (not copies of examples)\n2. Match the format, style, and quality exactly as shown in the examples\n3. Provide clear, detailed doctor responses\n4. Cover different medical topics if possible\n\nEXAMPLES (study the format carefully):\n\n================================================================================\nExample 1:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: will antidepressant and opioid combination develop serotonin syndrome in elderly\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor my father is a 73 year old male with the following diagnoses essential tremor congestive heart failure he has a pacemaker hypertension borderline diabetes arthritis in the hips depression moderate to severe and cognitive issues he received an epidural yesterday for pain in his hips and buttocks and my mother found his medication list and shared it with me I am somewhat alarmed about the anti depressants and opioid combinations in particular after doing some research on serotonin syndrome kindly evaluate his prescription\n\nDOCTOR: hi looking at the age and co morbid conditions the polypharmacy multiple drugs is a must at the same time the clinician will assess monitor the patient for any serious side effects or drug incompatibility since your father has many geriatric complaints I feel all these drugs are required due to old age he may be having some trouble with kidney or liver functions most of the drug gets metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys hence continuous monitoring is required as per the clinician advice I hope you are following the clinician advice regarding depression and pain in the hip the antidepressant drugs and analgesic are unavoidable please do not worry about its side effects like serotonin syndrome this is not seen in all the patients the symptoms of serotonin syndrome will be taken care of by other antihypertensive or cardiac drugs sometimes he develops diarrhea as I told earlier do not worry about the side effects these are not seen in all patients and these drugs are mandatory for your father he can avoid tyearamine rich foods example beer chocolate alcoholic beverages fermented foods cheese sore cream yogurt shrimp paste soy sauce soybean condiments teriyaki sauce tempeh miso soup sauerkraut kimchi etc the antidepressant drugs cause side effects only if more tyearamine rich food is consumed while under the medication I hope this helps\n\nSTATUS: high severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 2:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what is the possible diagnosis of increased perspiration which gets worse with stress\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor patient is a 35 year old woman many years ago she suffered from increased perspiration during night from the child when year old this was continuous making several changes of clothes a day necessary the situation was worse during physical or emotional stress in addition she had polydipsia but urine volumes were normal she was underweight even though she had polyphagia and was with tiredness and asthenia the latter was increased in recent years she tried many treatment types but none successful and improvement in her condition was not seen by the time the patient was 37 keg 160 am and was eating 0 500 calories per day her blood pressure was normal with 100 beats per minute her temperature was 36 8c 37 8c but sometimes rose to as high as 38 4c no thyearoid toxicity or thyearoid gland enlargement was present normal blood tests except for an elevated 24 hour urine creatinine but it was noted that her basal metabolic rate varied between 140 and 210 percent above normal specimens of muscle tissue were taken under local anesthesia from the patient the latter showed that respiration could proceed at a nearly maximal rate in the absence of add when add was supplied in excess phosphorylation to produce at proceeded as normal I have to diagnose this patient but I am in a dilemma because I think that from the details I have for her as mentioned above the biochemical pathway that is likely to be dysfunctional is glycolysis or glucose I am more towards the thought that she has a dysfunctional glycolysis pathway am I right for this or not what do you think also can you please suggest me what might be the underlying cause for the symptoms of hypermetabolism seen at her and what can be an evolutionary advantage for her\n\nDOCTOR: hi I have gone through your case details I am with your thought process of diagnosis let us try symptom analysis and the clinical syndrome that patient has the major symptom is hyperhidrosis that is increase sweating this can be due to primary hyperhidrosis or secondary hyperhidrosis this is less likely primary hyperhidrosis generalized sweating is mostly due to an underlying systemic illness or as a side effect of medication while focal sweating is generally due to a neurologic disorder or primary hyperhidrosis in this case it is generalized sweating we need to find out are there signs and symptoms of infection acute or chronic neoplasia metabolic endocrine disease diabetes thyearoid pheochromocytoma carcinoid high catecholamine state respiratory failure heart disease pain drug etoh withdrawal drug therapy propranolol antidepressants pilocarpine physostigmine neurologic disease dysautonomia diencephalic epilepsy hypothalamic lesion structural brain abnormality in your case it has a high metabolic rate with the childhood onset disease process so metabolic endocrine and high catabolic state is likely diagnosis in the metabolic it is more mitochondrial metabolic disorder likely diagnosis the mitochondrial damage results in defects in the electron transport chain can affect any tissue tissues requiring the highest levels of energy production are the most severely affected certain red flags which should immediately increase the suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder these include short stature neurosensory hearing loss progressive external ophthalmoplegia axonal neuropathy diabetes mellitus hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and renal tubular acidosis hope this insight will help you primary hyperhidrosis secondary hyperhidrosis metabolic myopathy mitochondrial disorder electron chain transfer morgan syndrome autoimmune serum lactate muscle biopsy for metabolic myopathy mitochondrial disorder genetic analysis mitochondrial disorder as per diagnosis antioxidants vitamin and riboflavin avoid excessive exercise to keep hydrated\n\nSTATUS: low severity\n\n================================================================================\nExample 3:\n================================================================================\nDESCRIPTION: what is the difference of sleep disturbance caused by hormonal problem and stress\n\nPATIENT: hello doctor what are the causes of sleep disturbances what are some ways to tell if your sleep troubles are sleep anxiety and not a hormonal problem what is the difference between sleep disturbances that are caused by hormones is stress how might someone address each of these different causes of sleep disturbances\n\nDOCTOR: hello first we should know the patient gender then if female ask if the sleep problems are all the time or more evident prior to periods due date then I would ask both female and male patients to run a thyearoid function test while female patients to also check sexual hormone levels in the blood stress makes it difficult to fall asleep and keep asleep and altering sleep quality hormonal changes will cause an increase in body heat which becomes not stable and adrenalin which alter the quality of sleep and time of sleeping estrogen will cause an increase in body fat in women more around the tummy this will cause snoring and sleep apnea we should ask patients more details about their sleep like is it difficult to fall asleep why do you wake up during the night how many times if yes why in this way we will find more details about the sleeping problems my patients are having sometimes they can sleep but they are so anxious and feel not enough to sleep\n\nSTATUS: medium severity\n\n================================================================================\nNOW: Generate a NEW unique medical consultation scenario following the EXACT same format above:\n\nDESCRIPTION: [brief medical question]\nPATIENT: [detailed patient narrative]\nDOCTOR: [clear, detailed medical advice - write naturally, don't worry about formatting]\nSTATUS: [low severity / medium severity / high severity]\n\nGenerate ONLY the new scenario, no meta-commentary.",
